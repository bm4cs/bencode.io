## Inside Out

Start with self, the most inside part of self (paradigms, character and motives). Private victories precede public victories, that is making and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making an keeping promises to others.


## Habits

A habit is the intersection of knowledge, skill and desire. Knowledge is the *what to, why to*. Skill is the *how to*. And desire the motivation, the *want to*. Creating a habit requires work in all three dimensions.


## Character vs Personality Ethic

The **character ethic** is the idea that a person advances based on their character. Interestingly, building of the character was culturally expressed until about WW1, when pop-culture began to focus on shortcuts and quick fix way to manipulate situations or people. The character ethic depends on deep changes within us. The **personality ethic** does not challenge us, neither does it bring about deep changes within us. Phrases characteristic of the two: Character ethic; integrity, patience. Personality ethic; think positive, believe in yourself.

When we have false concepts of the world around us, we are destined to failure, no matter how hard one might try. In the same way a navigating a complex city would be with a false or incorrect map. Thus the very danger of the personality ethic. I should constantly strive to have a correct and healthy understanding of the world.


## Principles

Time worn values that have emerged through generations and social contexts. Values such as *seek first to understand, then to be understood* or the golden rule *do unto others what you would have done unto you* are those of which effective people of all ages have embraced. Values however are not quick fixes, and something that can be learnt or applied overnight, requiring work and mastery in order to become effective.


## Efficiency vs Effectiveness

You can be efficient with thing, but never people. With people you must be effective.


## The P/PC Balance

P = Production; the desired results or "the golden eggs". PC = Production Capability; the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs, "the goose". A product is usually a result produced continually or on a regular basis. Maintaining the balance between P and PC is key to acheiving effectiveness. 

You want to avoid an imbalance (i.e. the golden egg mentality) wherever possible, and can be applied to all kinds of assets, physical, financial and human. Some examples, physical could be our body or a machine like a lawn mower or car, human could be a marriage or parents relationship with their child, and so on.


## Tips

Shift your paradigm of own involvement with the books material from the role of learner, to that of teacher. Take an inside-out approach, and read with the purpose in mind of sharing or discussing what you learn with someone else 48 hours after you learn it.


## Be Proactive

Between stimulus and response. Story of Victor Frankl, a jew imprisoned in the death camps of Nazi Germany. Frankl discovered what he called "the last of the human freedoms", he was a self-aware being who culd look as an observer at his very involvement. Between what happened to him (the stimulus) and his response to it, was his power to choose that response.

To be proactive means more than merely taking initative. As a human being, are responsible for my own life. My behaviour is a function of my decisions, not conditions. I can subordinate my feelings to values, and I have the initiative and responsibility to make things happen.

Responsibility. "response-ability" The ability to choose my response. Proactive people do not blame circumstances, conditions or conditioning for their behaviour. Their behaviour is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of conditions or feelings.

Reactive traits:
- Influenced by outside factors or environment (e.g. if the weather is bad = bad mood)
- Blame external factors.
- Rarily take accountabiliy (e.g. I can't vs I choose).
- Has a large circle of concern, and a small circle of influence (e.g focuses energies on many problems and topics that they cannot influence).

Proactive traits:
