PostgreSQL (*postgres* or `pg`) is an amazing open source relational database that provides the SQL DSL for interacting with data. Installation is a breeze with any package manager, packages to grab:

* `postgresql` and `postgresql-common`: core server
* `postgresql-client-common` and `postgresql-client`: client libs and binaries
* `postgresql-contrib`: useful bolt on modules

Once installed, is managed as a daemon by systemd.

    $ sudo systemctl start postgresql
    $ sudo systemctl stop postgresql
    $ sudo systemctl restart postgresql
    $ sudo systemctl reload postgresql
    $ sudo systemctl status postgresql


# Core Concepts

## Configuration

Depends on distro, generally somewhere like `/etc/postgresql/11/main`.

* `postgresql.conf` the main config file, by default psql runs on port 5432, and the data directory lives in `var` somewhere like `/var/lib/postgresql/11/main`
* `pg_hba.conf` host based authentication
* `pg_ident.conf` ident authentication config





## Roles and Security

Postgres simplifies users and groups, into the *role* (i.e. they are users, they are roles).

A number of authentication methods are available, with the default being **ident**.

* `ident` and `peer`: if a local nix account that has the same name as a psql role, can sign in as that role. Optional user to role mappings can go in `pg_ident.conf`. `ident` applies to TCP/IP, and `peer` for local connections.
* `md5`: takes an MD5 hashed password
* `password`: clear text
* `trust`: no password needed, based on an IP/user/DB match
* `reject`: deny immediately
* `GSSAPI`: standard secure auth protocol defined in RFC2743, and often combined with Kerberos
* `SSPI`: for Microsoft environments, uses Kerberos when possible, will fall back to NTLM
* and lots more `kerberos`, `LDAP`, `RADIUS`, `Certificate` and `PAM`

By default, only the `postgres` user has read/write access to the configuration files, to edit make sure you are running as this identity.

To allow a non-default login, open up the the `pg_hba.conf` (host based auth) config file.

    $ sudo -u postgres vim pg_hba.conf



# Basics

## Connectivity

Starting off with `ident` authentication, by default on installation a new OS user and PG role called `postgres` is created. Running the `psql` client as this user is one way to gain initial access, i.e. yb `sudo -i -u postgres` or by running `psql` under the user `sudo -u postgres psql`.

    postgres=# SELECT version();
                                                             version                                                              
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PostgreSQL 11.1 (Ubuntu 11.1-1.pgdg18.04+1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 7.3.0-27ubuntu1~18.04) 7.3.0, 64-bit
    (1 row)


Enabling remote access, is generally a first desirable goal.

1. Open `postgresql.conf` (from above), and uncomment `listen_addresses = 'localhost'`, change `localhost` to `*` (bind to all addresses)
1. Open `pg_hba.conf`, and add `host all all 192.168.1.0/24 trust` (substituting the network and CIDR for whats appropriate)
1. Bounce the PostgreSQL server process `sudo systemctl restart postgresql`
1. From a remote (client) host verify the port is open with a port scan `nmap -sT 192.168.1.238` (thats my psql server).

    $ nmap -sT 192.168.1.238
    
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.238
    PORT     STATE SERVICE
    22/tcp   open  ssh
    5432/tcp open  postgresql





## Client Utilities

PostgreSQL ships with several handy [client applications](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/reference-client.html). You can see the symlinks to them in `/usr/bin` by running `ls -l /usr/bin | grep postgres`.

* `clusterdb` cluster a database
* `createdb` create a new database
* `createlang` install a procedural language
* `createuser` define a new user account
* `dropdb` remove a database
* `droplang` remove a procedural language
* `dropuser` remove a user account
* `pg_basebackup` take a base backup of a cluster
* `pgbench` run a benchmark test
* `pg_dump` extract a database into a script file or other archive file
* `pg_dumpall` extract a database cluster into a script file
* `pg_isready` check the connection status of a server
* `pg_receivewal` stream write-ahead logs from a server
* `pg_receivexlog` streams transaction logs from a cluster
* `pg_recvlogical` control logical decoding streams
* `pg_restore` restore a database from an archive file created by `pg_dump`
* `psql` interactive terminal
* `reindexdb` reindex a database
* `vacuumdb` garbage-collect and analyze a database

For example to create a user and database, could run:

    $ sudo -u postgres createuser --login ben

And:

    $ sudo -u postgres createdb --owner=ben foodb

To make the `ben` role a *superuser* could have passed the `-s` switch to `createuser`, to promote the existing low powered role, can leverage the `ALTER USER` SQL command. First can review existing role permissions with a quick `\du`:

    $ sudo -u postgres psql
    postgres=# \du
                                       List of roles
     Role name |                         Attributes                         | Member of 
    -----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
     ben       |                                                            | {}
     postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}

Then the SQL:

    postgres=# ALTER USER ben WITH SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE REPLICATION LOGIN;
    ALTER ROLE


Verification:

    postgres=# \du
                                       List of roles
     Role name |                         Attributes                         | Member of 
    -----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
     ben       | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication             | {}
     postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}


Several privileges are available and [well documented](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html):

* `SUPERUSER` can override any access controls within the database. Dangerous.
* `CREATEDB` can spin up new dbs
* `CREATEROLE` can create/drop roles (users)
* `INHERIT` automatically applies powers of *roles* that the role is a member of (without explicit `SET ROLE`)
* `LOGIN` can be used for initial session authorisation (i.e. a user)
* `REPLICATION` needed for connectivity to servers in replication mode.
* `BYPASSRLS` bypass row-level security (RLS) policy.

Each of the below has an explicit deny version of the privilege, prefixed with **NO**, e.g. `NOSUPERUSER`.



## psql Primer

* `\?`: show all psql commands
* `\h` show SQL syntax help
* `\c` dbname [username]: Connect to database, with an optional username (or `\connect`)

Display commands (append `+` for extra details):

* `\l`: List all database (or `\list`)
* `\d`: Display all tables, indexes, views, and sequences
* `\dt`: Display all tables
* `\di`: Display all indexes
* `\dv`: Display all views
* `\ds`: Display all sequences
* `\dT`: Display all types
* `\dS`: Display all system tables
* `\du`: Display all users
* `\x` auto|on|off: Toggle|On|Off expanded output mode


To change database use `\c`:

    \c enceladus
    enceladus=#

To get specific SQL statement help, try handy psql command `\h`:

    enceladus=# \h CREATE TABLE

    Command:     CREATE TABLE
    Description: define a new table
    Syntax:
    CREATE [ [ GLOBAL | LOCAL ] { TEMPORARY | TEMP } | UNLOGGED ] TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name ( [
      { column_name data_type [ COLLATE collation ] [ column_constraint [ ... ] ]
        | table_constraint
    ....

Go for it:

    enceladus=# drop table if exists master_plan;
    enceladus=# create table master_plan(
    enceladus(#   id serial primary key,
    enceladus(#   the_date date,
    enceladus(#   title varchar(100),
    enceladus(#   description text
    enceladus(# );
    CREATE TABLE



## SQL script files

Great for reusable SQL, and putting into Git.

    psql foodb -h 10.1.2.3 < build.sql

Or:

    psql foodb -h 10.1.2.3 -f build.sql



# Importing Data (ETL)

Generally ETL software is bloat. KISS with:

* Idempotent shell scripts and `make` files. Idempotency is important, so that scripts can be reliably run numerous times and result in the same outcome. All data should be typed as `TEXT`, typing and cleanup can be dealt with later on.
* If needed, elevate to Python using *Pandas* or *PETL*
* If needed, elevate by considering a dedicating piece of middleware such as *Kafka* or *Logstash*


Digging through the help `\h COPY` found `COPY FROM` will be useful for extracting the CSV on disk:

> copy data between a file and a table

For example:

    COPY master_plan
    FROM '<put_path_here>/master_plan.csv'
    WITH DELIMITER ',' HEADER CSV;

Note, the SQL based approach is server based, i.e. the csv path will need to be accessible by the server itself.

For a client side approach can leverage the `\copy` commands, like so:

    \copy master_plan FROM '/home/ben/code/psql/cassini_data/curious_data/data/master_plan.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' HEADER CSV;
