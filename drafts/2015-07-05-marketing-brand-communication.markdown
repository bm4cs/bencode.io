### Perception

The development of an interpretation of a stimulus, or just deciding what stimulus means. Crucial because:

1. What customers perceive is what affects their actions.
2. What is perceived is not necessarily what is true.

Perception is constructive; people construct interpretations as a function of context. Meanings are based on two major factors:

1. Actual stimulus or event; exposure and attention (what is salient).
2. Once exposed, our prior expectations and what we know (perceptual interpretation). As a result are frequently biased.


**Perceptual Process**

Sensory inputs => Exposure => Attention => Interpretation

### Stroop Test

Perceptual organisation: proximity and similarity.


### Choosing a brand name

**Brand elements** - elements that inherently enhance brand awareness forming strong, favorable and unique brand associations.

- Brand name
- Logo
- Symbol
- Character
- Packaging
- Slogan
- Color

How well do the elements work together to provide an identity?

What would customers think if they only had the brand elements to assess from?

**Brand element choice criteria**
- Memorable - easily recognised and recalled.
- Meaningful - descriptive and persuaive.
- Appealing - fun and interesting, aesthetically, rich visual imagery.
- Protectable - legally, competitively.
- Adaptable - to stay modern, flexible, updateable.
- Transferable - within and across product categories, across geographical boundaries and cultures.

**Effect of brand names**

Consumers - affects likelihood of purchase.
Employees - affects morale and productivity.
Firm - can limit opportunities - e.g. new products, new regions.
Investors - can cause subconscious judgements about the company's merits/strengths.

**Types of names**

- Descriptive - lean cuisine
- Metaphor - represents attributes - infinity
- Surname - ford, ralph lauren
- Arbitrary - apple, camel
- Altered - fictional words based on real words - lucent, spotify
- Blended - two words merged - facebook
- Invented - nonsense words - exxon


### Value of a Good Name

Virgin - "well we're all virgins here, and if we started a record company we'd be virgins at that too"
Priceline - very crisp, clear about its intent.
Google - meaning of a very large number, but misspelled.


**Names for new start-ups** - new businesses need their own websites and most recognizable URLs have already been taken. Solution? Invent words.


### Color

- Ultimate goal is to own a color. Example, Tiffany's light blue box, Mary Kay's pink.
- Different viewers experience color differently.
- Ensuring consistency of color across platforms/media is difficult.
- Colors can create very strong perceptions - gold/silver, versus black/white

**Two axes of color** - plots the relationship between arousal and affect of color. Arousal tends not to apply across different cultures in the same way.

**Rules about color**

- Red - though to stimulate appretite, also love (passion), excitment.
- Blue - preferred by men, productive color, curbs appretite
- Green - tranquility and health, money, nature, fertility (M&Ms)
- Brown - reliability, boredom, practicality, earth
- White - purity, innocence, empty, spacious (creates illusion of space)
- Black - evil, death, mourning, slimming
- Yellow - bright, gives you energy, can make babies cry
- Orange - enthusiasm, warmth, caution
- Purple - royalty, wealth, success, wisdom
- Lavender - calms the nerves, relaxation.

### Slogans and taglines

- Can be tailored to be a positioning strategy.
- Can remove some of the ambiguity associated with brand and/or symbol.
- Can generate its own equity/emotion ("reach out and touch someone").
- Can reinforce the name or symbol ("from sharp minds come sharp products").

**Tagline basics**

- Short
- Differentiated from competition.
- Unique
- Easy to say and remember
- Negative connotations
- Protected and trademarked (e.g. nikes "just do it")

Types of taglines

- Imperative - "just do it" (nike), "invent" (hp), "think different" (apple)
- Descriptive - "moving at the speed of business" (ups), "bullish on america" (merrill lynch)
- Superlative - "the ulimate driving machine" (bmw)
- Provocative - "got milk?" (dairy council)
- Clever - "drivers wanted" (vw)


### Packaging

1930's packaging research, when self-service supermarkets started becoming popular.

Same detergent in packaging with (1) circles and (2) triangles - people consistently preferred the packaging with circles.

**Packaging drives**

- Influence at the point of purchase.
- Continuing influence at the point of consumption.
- Multiple objectives - identify, present information, protect and allow transportation, store, aid consumption.


**Creating impactful packaging**

- Understand that package aesthetics and function are both critical. Must grab consumers attention in the sea of competing messages. Work so well that consumers will buy it again.
- Know your distribution channels. How do retailers view your package? How are channels changing? Which retailers like what packaging configurations?



### Persuasion

An active attempt to change belief and attitude. Difficult to acheive!

Elaboration Likelihood Model - is the dominant model in attacking a consumer, and has two methods:

1. **Central Route**. When motivation, opportunity and ability to process marketing messages are high. Focus mainly on "central cues" in the messages.
2. **Peripheral Route**. When the consumer is not motivated.


    Exposure to Marketing Cures => Motivation to Elaborate => (Low Involvement) Peripheral Route
                                                           => (High Involvement) Ability to Elaborate => (No) Peripheral Route
                                                                                                      => (High ability) Central Route


#### Peripheral cues

- Classical conditioning - pavlov's conditioning.
- Reciprocity - you owe me.
- Consistency - we've always done it that way.
- Social proof - everybody's doing it.
- Liking - love me, love my ideas.
- Authority - just because I say so.
- Scarcity - quick, before it sells out. Quality.

High Q-rating (www.qscores.com)

## Repositioning a Brand

5 rationales for brand change:

1. The identity was poorly conceived.
2. The target for the identity is limited. Customer segment is tough, and perhaps not profitable.
3. The identity has become out of date.
4. Lose of edge, becomes old fashioned.
5. Just become tired. Boring to consumers.


#### Potential Cognitive Inconsistency

Myself => Smoking => Death

Logic chains can be manipulated (e.g. I'm going to die anyway, I don't really smoke, I don't beleive the data behind smoking and death).


### Major points of repositioning a brand

- Consistency over time is very valuable in building strong brands.
- All brand elements should work in harmony to communicate brand identity.
- Change is sometimes necessary - but be cautious.
- Understand sources of equity and current contributions to POP and POD, strength, favorability and uniqueness.
