Last week I got the chance to participate in a hackathon run by KPMG, which focused around on ideas around Australian Government related services. The project I hacked on in a nutshell:
> To automate the scheduling of medical care and transportation services, for Australian veterans.

We built a smartphone app based on React Native, which was amazing.

The hackathon itself was well organised. Some things that I think worked really well:

* Marketplace style pitching.
* After party.
* Catering and coffee.
* Business representives and buy-in.
* Master classes.
* Designers.
