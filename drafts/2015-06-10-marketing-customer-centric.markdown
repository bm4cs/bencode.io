### What is product centricity

In a product centric approach, the goal of the firm is to maximise shareholder value.

- Coming up with a great idea/product, to maximise profits through volume and cost reductions. That is, scalability.
- KPI's such as market share, volumes delivered, reduction in costs.
- Growth through extending the product (targeting fresh sources of consumers, innovation, R&D, new products).
- Product focused organisational structure (e.g. product managers).


### Problems with product centric approach

- Commoditisation - technology today makes it simplier to fabricate and manufacture products/services.
- Smart customers - informed customers, through IT.
- Distribution technology - geolocality is no longer such a barrier (retail saturation).
- Globalisation - 
- Deregulation - 
- Customers want end-to-end solutions (not piece meal individual components). Example, IBM made the transition from manufacting computer hardware, to becoming a customer focused solution provider (i.e. from a product to a customer centric business model).
- Customer level tracking and analytics again through IT.



### Direct marketing

The individual customer is the unit of analysis.

- Know who their customers are, and what they buy. What kinds of products do they return.
- Tailor customer marketing communication based on past purchases.
- Constantly determine and leverage individual customer value.



### Which firms are customer centric?

Out of Walmart, Apple, Starbucks, X, none of them are truly customer centric.

**Walmart**
- Knows suprising very little about each of its customers.
- Does not have a loyalty program.
- Have a generic understanding (e.g. for regions where a hurricane is expected, will stock up on batteries/water etc)
- Operational excellence. Driving efficiently high, and price low. Scan and go mobile app for example improves operational efficient, but new for Walmart, also allows the tracking of individual customers.

**Apple**
- Doesnt spend allot of time in understanding each customers needs.
- Very product focused.
- Performance superiority.

**Starbucks**
- Any coffee shop by nature is very customer centric. The barrister experience that is, or being a trusted advisor in other words.
- However, not customer centric consistently. E.g. presenting a loyalty card across stores, or in a different regions or countries is not permitted.
- Its not okay to be a trusted advisor only some of the time, and not at other times.

**Nordstrom**
- They treat each and every customer extremely well.
- Their failure to understand each customer, results in much waste.
- Only customers that are of future value, are worth investing in. Example, a customer turned up asking for a refund for tires. Nordstrom doesn't even stock tires, however continued to refund the customer.


### What is customer centricity

A strategy that **aligns a company's development/delivery of its products/services** around the current and future needs of a **select set of customers** in order to **maximise their long-term financial value** to the firm.

- Establishing a trusted advisor relationship with the customer, as opposed to selling another thing to them quickly to hit quartly profits.
- Long term investment, as opposed to short term thinking.
- R&D is focused on the customer. Develop something for them.
- Many companies are backward looking. Example, rewarding sales people for number of sales last quarter. Let's flip this. Be forward looking.
- Here's how a sales person of the month incentive should work. Calculate the value of each and every customer. Do it at the beginning, and the end of the month. Shouldn't be about how much was sold, but the focus on how much did we enrich/elevate the customer. Build relationships with the customer. On future value that the sales people are sowing the seeds to create. Requires faith, data and customer understanding.
- Encourage building long lasting relationships, not short term sales.

Another example. MBA students. They've been in the industry for a number of years, flying for their companies. The airlines recognise this, through loyalty programs. However during the couple of years while studying the MBA, all loyalty benefits are erradicated. If the airlines we're smart, they would realise what excellent customers they we're, and what even better customers they will become post their MBA program. This is a long term investment in the customer. This is customer centric focus, and is seen so rarely in industy today.




## Living in a customer centric world

- Like the product-centric model, the goal of the firm in a customer-centric model is exactly the same; its about **maximising shareholder value**.
- Celebrating customer heterogeneity; distinguish the profitable customers from the less profitable ones. Customers are really, really different from each other.
- Focus on future profitability (customer lifetime value) rather than past profits.
- Success through enhanced (and/or more efficient) customer **acquistition, retention and development**.
- Customer centric organisational structure. Ideally the org chart is built around the kinds of customers, and the way to extract profits from them.
- The competitive advantage; relationship/customer expertise with respect to focal customers. Customer trend data cannot be commoditised. Forcasts and data models that is.

Procter and Gamble (P&G) "my black is beautiful" campaigne, targetting cosmetics at afro-american women. Recommending their own and other products at this particular customer group. Aiming to become the trusted advisor.

Promotes divergent thinking (how may uses for this product) as opposed to convergent thinking (relationship management culture; searching for more customer needs to satisfy).

The **paradox of customer centricity**; the more a firm tightens its central focus on a select group of customers, the more it needs its non-focal customers to stabilise the overall mix.
