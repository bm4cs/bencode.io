My notes on getting more familiar with Go.


# Tooling

The [`go`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/) tool is a CLI for managing Go source.

## Run, build and install

Source is placed within `$GOPATH` like `$GOPATH/src/github.com/bm4cs/cool-app/main.go`

To just run a program, without building a binary output:

    $ go run main.go
    hello world

To build a statically linked binary output:

    $ go build
    $ file demo
    demo: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked

Cross compiling is available too:

    $ GOOS=windows go build
    $ file demo.exe
    demo.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64 (stripped to external PDB), for MS Windows

Optionally the binary can be written to `$GOPATH/bin`, which is normally on the `PATH`:

    $ go install
    $ ls $GOPATH/bin | grep demo
    demo



## Dependencies

    $ go get github.com/golang/example/hello
    $ $GOPATH/bin/hello
    Hello, Go examples!



## Formatting

Format a file to `stdout`:

    $ gofmt main.go

Diff:

    $ gofmt -d main.go

Update (write) the original source file:

    $ gofmt -w main.go


## Documentation

Local CLI help:

    $ go doc fmt Printf
    
    func Printf(format string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
    Printf formats according to a format specifier and writes to standard
    output. It returns the number of bytes written and any write error
    encountered.

Local documentation HTTP server:

    $ godoc -http :7070
