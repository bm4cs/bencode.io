### Quinoa and Apple Stuffing

Ingredients

- 1 cup quinoa
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt + 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1 1/2 cup + 1/2 cup low-sodium vegetable stock
- 1 diced apple
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme
- 2 tablespoon + 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup finely chopped leek
- 3/4 cup finely chopped celery
- 1 finely chopped shallot
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped sage
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries
- 1/3 cup finely chopped parsley

Directions

1. Rinse the quinoa in a sieve under water for approximately 30 seconds and drain thoroughly. Add it to a pot with the low-sodium vegetable stock and sea salt, and bring to a boil.
1. Once boiling, stir in the diced apple and cover with a lid. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 minutes. Once all the water is absorbed, remove the pot from the heat and stir in fresh thyme and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.

1. Add in dried cranberries and parsley and cook for another 2 minutes. Mix this into the quinoa and apple component and serve warm.

### Smashed Potato Nachos

Ingredients

- 1 1/2 lb or 4 cups baby red russet potatoes
- 1 teaspoon sea salt (optional)
- 4 plant-based sausages, halved and roughly chopped
- ½ white onion, small diced
- 2 teaspoons olive oil (optional)
- 1 cup cooked black beans
- 1 cup Sweet Potato Queso, warmed (see recipe)
- 1 tomato, diced
- 2 green onions, sliced thin
- ¼ cup jarred jalapeños
- ½ cup plant-based sour cream (see Classic Sour Cream recipe or choose your favorite store-bought option)
- Fresh corriander, for serving

Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425ºF/220ºC for roasting the potatoes later.
1. Clean the potatoes well. Place the potatoes in a seasoned pot of water, turn on heat to high and bring to a boil. Boil the potatoes until fork tender (about 12-15 minutes), strain and rinse.
1. Place the chopped plant sausages into a food processor and pulse until coarsely ground.
1. Warm a large pan over medium heat and add 1 teaspoon of the oil if cooking with oil (otherwise you can use a little water). Add the onions and sauté over medium heat until slightly softened and translucent. Add in the ground sausage and sauté for several minutes more, allowing the crumble to crisp up. Remove from heat.
1. Using a teaspoon of the olive oil, drizzle on a sheet pan, coating the pan thoroughly (optional). Evenly space the potatoes out on the seasoned sheet pan and, using a potato masher with some pressure, press each potato, smashing it slightly flat. Repeat with all the potatoes. Spray or lightly drizzle the remaining olive oil over the potatoes and sprinkle each with sea salt (optional). Place in oven.
1. Continue to roast for 15-20 minutes and remove the potatoes from oven once crispy.
1. Place half of the warm potatoes onto a serving platter or bowl, topping with ½ cup of the warmed Sweet Potato Queso, 1/2 the sausage crumble, and 1/2 the black beans. Add the rest of the potatoes to the platter, drizzling remaining ½ of the Queso, beans, and crumble. Finish with tomato, green onions, jalapeños, plant-based sour cream and cilantro garnish.
