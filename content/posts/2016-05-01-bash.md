Bash is a Unix shell written by Brian Fox in 1989 for the GNU Project as a free replacement for the [Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell). To this day, Bash remains one of the most powerful and ubiquitous scripting tools on the planet.

Kudos to Denys Dovhan and his awesome [Bash handbook](https://github.com/denysdovhan/Bash-handbook). The most digestable, and enjoyable method I've found to groking bash. <3

# Useful Shortcuts

See `man readline`

**Movement**

-   **Ctrl + A**: move cursor to beginning of line
-   **Ctrl + E**: move cursor to end of line
-   **Ctrl + L**: clear screen
-   **Alt + F**: Move cursor forward one word on the current line
-   **Alt + B**: Move cursor backward one word on the current line

**Editing**

-   **Ctrl + U**: delete from cursor to beginning of line
-   **Ctrl + K**: delete from cursor to end of line
-   **Ctrl + W**: delete whole word before the cursor
-   **Ctrl + H**: delete last character (backspace)
-   **Ctrl + T**: transfer (swap) the last two characters before the cursor
-   **Esc+T**: transfer (swap) the last two words before the cursor

**Process**

-   **Ctrl + C**: kill whatever is interactively running
-   **Ctrl + D**: exit the current session
-   **Ctrl + Z**: puts whatever is running into a suspended background process, use `fg` to restore it.

**History**

-   **Ctrl + R**: search through previous commands
-   **Ctrl + P**: previous command (from history)
-   **Ctrl + N**: next command (from history)
-   **!!**: the last command (handy when you forget to sudo, `sudo !!`)
-   **!1050**: run command 1050 (as journalled by `history`)

# Initialisation

Bash provides several config files, that can be used when a fresh bash instance is created. Such as:

-   `~/.bash_profile` user login-shell config
-   `~/.profile` user login-shell config
-   `~/.bashrc` user interactive (sub) shell config
-   `/etc/bash_profile` system-side login shell config
-   `/etc/profile` system-wide login-shell config
-   `/etc/bashrc` system-wide interactive (sub) shell config

A single `.bashrc` soon become bloated and convoluted. A nifty trick is to break things up into several smaller configs (`.bashrc`), and "including" them with the `source` command.

First somewhere to house the individual configs:

    mkdir ~/.bashrc.d
    chmod 700 ~/.bashrc.d

Then in the `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` include all child configs:

    for file in ~/.bashrc.d/*.bashrc;
    do
      source "$file"
    done

Then rip out chunks into `~/.bashrc.d/myfile.bashrc`. Ensure they all have execution rights:

    chmod +x ~/.bashrc.d/*.bashrc

# Shell Grammar

## Variables

### Local variables

A local variable can be declared using `=` sign (no spaces) and its value can be retrieved using the `$` sign.

    os="linux"
    echo $os
    unset os

We can also declare a variable local to a single function using the `local` keyword.

    local local_var="NAND gate"

### Environment variables

Environment variables are variables accessible to anything running in current shell session. They are created just like local variables, but using the keyword `export` instead.

    export GLOBAL_VAR="guten tag"

Bash comes with a bunch of [reserved variables](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_03_02.html), here's some handy ones:

| Variable    | Description                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$HOME`     | The current user's home directory.                                           |
| `$PATH`     | A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands. |
| `$PWD`      | The current working directory.                                               |
| `$RANDOM`   | Random integer between 0 and 32767.                                          |
| `$UID`      | The numeric, real user ID of the current user.                               |
| `$PS1`      | The primary prompt string.                                                   |
| `$PS2`      | The secondary prompt string.                                                 |
| `$OSTYPE`   | Operating system Bash is running on.                                         |
| `$HISTFILE` | File used to store command history.                                          |

Some like to make their prompt stand out from the noise (e.g. by making it bright green). Add to `~/.bash_profile`:

    export PS1="\[$(tput bold)\]\[$(tput setaf 2)\][\u@\h \W]\\$ \[$(tput sgr0)\]"

![Custom prompt string with PS1](/images/ps1.png "Custom prompt string with PS1")

Or goes nuts and colorise each component:

```
export PS1="\[$(tput bold)\]\[$(tput setaf 1)\][\[$(tput setaf 3)\]\u\[$(tput setaf 2)\]@\[$(tput setaf 4)\]\h \[$(tput setaf 5)\]\W\[$(tput setaf 1)\]]\[$(tput setaf 7)\]\\$ \[$(tput sgr0)\]"
```

### Positional arguments

Defined within the context of a function.

-   `$0`: Name of script.
-   `$1` to `$9`: The parameter list elements from 1 to 9.
-   `${10}` to `${N}`: The parameter list elements from 10 to N.
-   `$*` or `$@`: All positional parameters except `$0`.
-   `$#`: The number of parameters, not counting `$0`.
-   `$FUNCNAME`: The function name.

## Expansions

### Brace expansion

Using a pair curly braces `{` and `}`, can be used to generate strings or ranges of numbers.

```bash
echo beg{i,a,u}n # begin began begun
echo {e..a} # e d c b a
```

```bash
echo {0..5} # 0 1 2 3 4 5
echo {00..8..2} # 00 02 04 06 08
```

### Command substitution

Stores the result of an evaluation into a variable, or passes the result along for another evaluation. Done by enclosing the expression either in backticks \`, or within `$()`.

```bash
kernel=$(uname -r)
#or
kernel=`uname -r`
echo $kernel #4.4.6-301.fc23.x86_64
```

### Arithmetic expansion

Bash eats arithmetic for breakfast. Syntax is similar to the command substitution capture group `$()`, but doubles up on the braces `$(())`.

```bash
bug=$(( ((10 + 5*3) - 7) / 2 ))
echo $bug # 9
echo \$(( bug \* 1000 )) #9000
```

### Double and single quotes

Unlike single quotes, with double quotes, variables and command substitutions are expanded automatically.

```bash
echo "Your home: $HOME" # Your home: /home/vimjock
echo 'Your home: $HOME' # Your home: \$HOME
```

If a variable contains whitespace, take care to expand it in double quotes, which will preserve the literal value of all characters.

```bash
WEIRD="A string that is just trouble"
echo $WEIRD   # A string that is just trouble
echo "$WEIRD" # A string that is just trouble
```

Words of the form `$'string'` expands, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard (such as `\n` for newline, `\t` for horizontal tab, `\u3b2` for unicode character `3b2`, and so on).`

## Stream Redirection

Bash views the outside world (input and output) as streams of data. The brilliant thing about streams, like water streams, is that their flow can be channeled in and out of many upstream and/or downstream programs, creating complex results.

0 | stdin | The standard input.
1 | stdout | The standard output.
2 | stderr | The errors output.

Redirection operators for controlling the flow of streams:

| Operator    | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `>`         | Redirecting output                                                                            |
| `>>`        | Append redirecting output                                                                     |
| `&>`        | Redirecting output and error output, `&>pepsi` same as `>pepsi 2>&1`                          |
| `&>>`       | Appending redirected output and error output                                                  |
| `<`         | Redirecting input                                                                             |
| `<<[-]word` | _Here documents_ read input until `word` is found                                             |
| `<<<word`   | _Here strings_, like here documents, but `word` undergoes expansion (brace, arithmetic, etc). |

The order of redirections is important.

    ls > dirlist 2>&1

Directs both `stdout` and `stderr` to file `dirlist`. While:

    ls 2>&1 > dirlist

Directs only `stdout` to the file `dirlist`.

Another example:

    join <(sort file1.txt) <(sort file2.txt)

This will bind the outputs of two sort commands, as input arguments one and two of the join command:

Bash redirection can integrate with logical devices:

`/dev/fd/fd` | File descriptor `fd` is duplicated.
`/dev/stdin` | File descriptor `0` is duplicated.
`/dev/stdout` | File descriptor `1` is duplicated.
`/dev/stderr` | File descriptor `2` is duplicated.
`/dev/tcp/host/port` | Open the corresponding TCP socket.
`/dev/udp/host/port` | Open the corresponding UDP socket.

Often when running text searches as a low privileged user, you will encounter permission and other errors, like this:

    $ grep ben /etc/*
    grep: abrt: Is a directory
    grep: audisp: Permission denied
    grep: audit: Permission denied
    ...

Lets redirect them to `/dev/null`:

    $ grep ben /etc/* 2> /dev/null
    /etc/group:wheel:x:10:ben
    /etc/group:users:x:100:ben
    /etc/group:ben:x:1000:ben
    /etc/group:postgres:x:26:root,ben
    ...

Nice and clean.

### here documents

here documents are a bit rad:

```bash
$ python - <<"XXXX"
> foo=15
> print "Magical number of foo is %i.\n" %(foo,)
> XXXX
Magical number of foo is 15.
```

Another:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf << END
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.bencode.net:8080"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.bencode.net:8080"
END
```

## Arrays

```bash
langs[0]=c
langs[1]=java
langs[2]=go
```

Or as a single compound assignment:

```bash
langs=(c java go)
```

To refer individual elements:

```bash
echo ${langs[1]} # java
echo ${langs[*]} # c java go
echo \${langs[@]} # c java go
```

The `@` operator (unlike `*`) can honor whitespace.

```bash
langs=(c java go "visual basic")
printf "+ %s\n" "\${langs[@]}"

# c

# java

# go

# visual basic

```

Slicing:

```bash
langs=(c java go "visual basic")
echo \${langs[@]:1:2}

# java go

```

Adding:

```bash
langs=(c awk)
echo \${langs[@]}

# c awk

langs=(java "${langs[@]}" sql bash)
echo ${langs[@]}

# java c awk sql bash

```

Removing:

```bash
langs=(ruby python "visual basic" perl)
unset langs[2]
echo \${langs[@]}

# ruby python perl

```

Looping:

```bash
for lang in ${langs[@]}; do echo "$lang is nifty"; done

# ruby is nifty

# python is nifty

# perl is nifty

```

## Conditions

Expression is enclosed in double squares `[[ ]]`. Expressions can be daisy chained using the `&&` and/or `||` operators.

| `-R varname` | True if the shell variable varname is set and is a name reference. |

Strings:

| Test                                        | Description                                             |

| `arg1 -gt arg2` | greater than arg2             |
| `arg1 -ge arg2` | greater than or equal to arg2 |

### if statements

With single and multi line variants:

```bash

# single line

if [[ 100 -eq 100 ]]; then echo "one hungey"; else echo "no hungey"; fi

# multi line

if [[ "drpepper" == "drpepper" ]]; then
echo "one hungey"
else
echo "no hungey"
fi

# if else

if [[ -e main.c ]]; then
echo "found main"
elif [[ $(date +%A) == "Sunday" ]]; then
echo "day of rest"
else
echo "no dice"
fi
```

In some instances, such as pattern matching, omit double quotes:

```bash
if [[ $file == *.o ]]; then echo "its an ELF"; fi
```

### case statements

`|` to delimit multiple patterns,`)` to terminate the pattern list, `*` as default catch all pattern, and `;;` to divide each block.

```bash
file=h

if [[ -n $file ]]; then

case \$file in
"c"|"h")
echo "my precious source code"
;;
"o")
echo "silly object file, nuke it"
;;
\*)
echo "something else"
;;
esac
else
echo "not found bra";
fi
```

# Loops

Bash comes with C-like looping; `for`, `for in`, `select`, `while` and `until` loops. In addition bash also provides builtin `break` and `continue` commands, for manipulating the flow of loops.

## For Loops

The super handy `for`.

```bash
for hero in linus stallman ritchie kernighan pike fox
echo \$hero
done

Single line syntax:

```bash
for i in {1..5}; do echo \$i; done

#1
#2
#3
#4
#5
```

And lastly, the classical for:

```bash
for (( i = 0; i < 5; i++ )); do
echo \$i;
done

#0
#1
#2
#3
#4
```

Move shell scripts from one location, to another and change their permissions along the way.

```bash
for FN in $HOME/*.sh; do
  mv "$FN" "$HOME/scripts"
  chmod +x "$HOME/scripts/\${FN}"
done
```

## Select Loops

Useful for creating menus. The list of expanded words from a list is printed out, each preceded by a number. The `PS3` prompt is then displayed and a line is read from standard input.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
PS3="Please choose an environment: "
select ENV in dev tst ppd prd
do
echo -n "Enter build version to deploy: " && read BUILD
case $ENV in
    dev) echo "./doinst.bash $BUILD noddy" ;;
tst) echo "./doinst.bash $BUILD tulip" ;;
    ppd) echo "./doinst.bash $BUILD woody" ;;
prd) echo "./doinst.bash \$BUILD chipper" ;;
esac
break;
done
```

Here's what this does:

    $ ./select.bash
    1) dev
    2) tst
    3) ppd
    4) prd
    Please choose an environment: 2
    Enter build version to deploy: 1.6
    ./doinst.bash 1.6 tulip

## While Loops

The awesome keeps on coming.

```bash
x=0
while [[ $x -lt 5 ]]; do
echo $(( x * x ))
  x=$(( x + 1 ))
done

#0
#1
#4
#9
#16
```

## Until Loops

Opposite of `while`; keeping looping if the condition is _false_.

# Functions

A shell function stores a series of commands for later execution.

```bash
cool_func() {
echo "be cool"
}

cool_func
```

When a function is executed, the arguments to the function be the positional parameters during its execution. When the function is complete, these values are restored to the values they had prior to the functions execution. The function can return a result using an exit code.

```bash
get_day() {
day=\$(date +%A)

if [[ -n $1 ]]; then
echo "g'day $1, its $day"
else
echo "g'day cobber"
fi

return 0
}

get_day Benjamin # g'day Benjamin, its Wednesday
get_day # g'day cobber
```

# Bash Recipes

## Top 6 largest things in the current directory

```bash
du -hxs * | sort -hr | head -6
234M    code
30M     cygwin
6.8M    datatsudio
5.0M    c-projects
4.9M    scripts
```

## Display the 23rd line of /etc/passwd

```bash
head -n 23 /etc/passwd | tail -n 1
sed -n ' 23 p ' /etc/passwd
awk ' NR == 23 { print $0 } ' < /etc/passwd
```

## Filter the first column from process status

```bash
awk ' { print $1 } ' <(ps -aux)
```

## Delete Subversion scrap files

Delete files that report a status of `?`

    $ svn status bnc
    M    bnc/amin.c
    ?    bnc/dmin.c
    ?    bnc/mdiv.tmp
    A    bnc/optrn.c
    M    bnc/optson.c
    ?    bnc/prtbout.4161
    ?    bnc/rideaslist.odt

A possible solution using a `while` loop and a combination of `grep`, `cut` and `rm`:

```bash
svn status bnc | grep '^?' | cut -c8- | while read FILE; do echo "$FN"; rm -rf "$FN"; done
```

Alternatively the `read` statement can be used to do the parsing:

```bash
svn status bnc | \
while read TAG FN
do
if [[ $TAG == \? ]]
then
echo $FN
    rm -rf "$FN"
fi
done
```

## Move shell scripts and mark them as executable

```bash
for FN in $HOME/*.sh; do
  mv "$FN" "$HOME/scripts"
  chmod +x "$HOME/scripts/\${FN}"
done
```

## Pattern matching

```bash
text=DOOM89761234rocks

if [[ $text =~ ([[:alpha:]]*)[[:digit:]]+([[:alpha:]]*) ]]; then
  echo "${BASH_REMATCH[1]} \${BASH_REMATCH[2]}";
else
echo "wat";
fi
```

**Output**

    DOOM rocks

## Scan code base against list of patterns

Given a list of patterns, scan a code base for them, and report a total of how many hits there were for each.

```bash
cut -d $'\t' -f 2 keywords.txt | while read KEYWORD; do COUNT=$(grep -rnwo ~/code/git/das/src --include _.java --include _.jsp -e \""$KEYWORD"\" | wc -l); if [[ $COUNT -gt 0 ]]; then echo "$KEYWORD $COUNT"; fi; done

#AUTHOR 8
#ENV 19

#
```

## Rename Multiple Files

Given a bunch of files named in the form `game.of.thrones.s04e10.hdtv.x264.mp4`, each contained within their own subdirectory. First I wanted to remove the all subdirs, flattening out the tree, and then finish up by renaming each file to the simplier form `GOT.S04E10.mp4`.

Using `find`, locate all subdirectories, moving any contents they may have back into the parent directory. The `-exec` switch has its limitations, such as with logical `&&` operators, which requires a real shell (`sh`).

```bash
find . -name "Game*" -type d -exec sh -c 'cd "{}" && mv * ../' \;
```

The subdirectories can be disposed of:

```bash
find . -name "Game*" -type d -exec rm -rf "{}" \;
```

Now the renaming with `sed`. By leveraging capture groups (donuts) in `sed` (eg `\1`), can pick out match results of interest and jam them into the substitution result. While here takes advantage of the casing functionality by decorating the capture group with either a `\U` for uppercasing or `\L` for lower.

```bash
for f in *.*; do mv "$f" "GOT.`echo $f | sed -rn ' s/.*([sS][0-9]{2}[eE][0-9]{2}).*(\..{3})/\U\1\L\2/p '`"; done
```

## Run a command every time a file is modified

```bash
while inotifywait -e close_write report.tex
do
  make
done
```

## Keep a program running after leaving SSH session

If no input is required:

```bash
nohup ./script.sh &
```

Otherwise:

```bash
./script.sh
<provide input as needed>
<Ctrl-Z>            # sleep the process
jobs -l             # figure out the job id
disown -h <jobid>   # disown the job
bg -h <jobid>       # continue running
```

## Simple menu and functions

```bash
me="$(basename "$(test -L "$0" && readlink "$0" || echo "$0")")"
u="$USER"
stow=/usr/bin/stow

menu()
{
	echo "usage:   " $me "[OPTION]"
	echo " "
	echo "init:    Install the basics (git/yay)"
	echo "dots:    Get dots from github (into '~/dots' folder)"
	echo "stow:    Restore home stow from dots repo"
	echo "unstow:  Cleanup home stow from dots repo"
	echo "apps:    Use 'yay' to install all programs"
	echo "dwm:     Clones dwm repo and applies patches"
	echo " "
}

init()
{
	cd /tmp/
	curl -LO https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/yay.tar.gz
	tar xvzf yay.tar.gz
	cd yay
	makepkg -sci
	sudo pacman -S --needed git
}

dwm()
{
	cd ~
	rm -r dwm
	git clone git://git.suckless.org/dwm
	cd dwm
	curl -LO https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/center/dwm-center-6.1.diff:
}

apps()
{
	test -f ~/dots/restore/applist && yay -S --needed - < ~/dots/restore/applist || echo "Do dots & stow first dude!"
}

dots()
{
	cd ~
	git clone git@github.com:bm4cs/dots.git
}

stow()
{
	cd ~/dots/stow-home
	for d in *; do $stow -t ~ $d; done

	#Setup ROOT stow files
	#cd ~/dots/stow_root; for d in *; do sudo stow -t / $d; done
}

unstow()
{
	cd ~/dots/stow-home
	for d in *; do
		$stow -D -t ~ $d || true
	done
}

restow()
{
    if [ -n "$1" ]; then
	    cd ~/dots/stow-home/
        $stow -D -t ~ $1 || true
	    $stow -t ~ $1
    fi
}



if [ -n "$1" ]; then
	$1 ${@:2}
else
	menu
fi
```
