> Kinesis is a company based near Seattle that offers computer keyboards with ergonomic designs as alternatives to the traditional keyboard design. Most widely known among these are the contoured Advantage line, which features recessed keys in two bucket-like hollows to allow the user's fingers to reach keys with less effort

The Advantage 360 line was released in 2022 and is still insanely popular and challenging to get hold of. The pro edition allows you to customise the firmware, which is ZMK based. Kinesis have outsourced the actual job of compiling the firmware to GitHub Actions.

## ZMK firmware customisation workflow

1. Fork the [repo](https://github.com/KinesisCorporation/Adv360-Pro-ZMK)
1. Enable GitHub Actions on the fork
1. Set the configuration UI to the fork
1. Make changes, then hit the big green _Commit Changes_ button
1. This will trigger the [GitHub action](https://github.com/bm4cs/Adv360-Pro-ZMK/actions) on your fork, to compile the firmware
1. Wait for the GitHub Action to complete, click into it, download the freshly baked `firmware.zip`, which contains two firmware blobs, `left.uf2` and `right.uf2`
1. Plug the left module in via USB C to the host machine and have it enter reset mode, using a paperclip double press the button tucked down in the middle of the thumb cluster (between the delete, home and end keys)
1. This will cause the module to present as a mass storage device. Copy the file `left.uf2` to it, as you would for any other storage device. The LEDs will flash. Wait for the module to reflash the firmware copied. Once its down it will automatically unmount itself from the host.
1. Repeat the same steps, but for the right module, being careful to copy `right.uf2` to it.
