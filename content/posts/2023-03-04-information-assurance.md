This is a work in a progress.

Kicking off the University year of 2023 at UNSW and ADFA in the Cybersecurity Masters program I am taking [Infomation Assurance and Security](https://legacy.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/courses/2018/ZEIT8021.html).

> Provides students with a deep understanding of the technical, management and organisational aspects of Information Assurance within a holistic legal and social framework.

The course is modelled off the [CISSP certification](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP#), which dives into the following subjects:

- make a realistic assessment of the needs for information security in an organisation
- discuss the implications of security decisions on the organisation's information systems
- understand the principles of writing secure code
- show an understanding of database and network security issues
- demonstrate an understanding of encryption techniques
- understand foundations of the tools and techniques in computer forensics
- show an appreciation of the commercial, legal and social context in which IT security is implemented
- apply knowledge gained to business and technical IA scenarios

## Module 1: Intro

Not a one size fits all approach. Too many factors and seemingling chaotic variables, such as risk appetites, country legislation, the business vertical (mining vs banking vs government), acceditation frameworks that apply to certain industries, tolerances, technology limitations, and so on.

The systems engineering "V" provides a useful structured approach to building a complex system, integrating it and validating it. Security can be integrated at every stage in the "V", from high level architecture, component designs, software development, security unit testing (such as fuzzing), validating common vectors, ensuring that security mechanisms are effective such as anomogy detection systems.

A large part of effective IA is groking the business, maintaining alignment with organisational objectives, sensitivity to risk appetite and clarity of return of investment are vital to the success of an IA program.

At this stage there is no need to dig into the specific technologies or security controls of implementations or the services offered. Rather, the goal is at the executive summary level, of the following:

- _Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)_ What is the problem, what is the solution. Why is it a solution (better, cheaper, faster, other?). What is the business value? Are there different audiences?
- _Organisational Context_ Organisation function, environment, risks and risk appetite. What are the organisational drivers (economics, competition)? Relevant business strategy.
- _Options and Justification_ Options aligned to problem, relevant costs. Credible data. Key stakeholders / relationships. Security and technology strategy
- _Recommendation and Next Steps_ Clear and action-oriented summary. Roles and governance for the plan. Traceability to BLUF and options. How will we see progress?
