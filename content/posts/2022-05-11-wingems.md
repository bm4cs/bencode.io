## Purpose

Modern Windows as we know it is a decendent of the original NT (new technology) code base started by the legendary [Dave Cutler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Cutler) and his team in 1988. Dave was known to have a distain for UNIX and took a different approach to building his new OS.

Windows is jam packed with weird and wonderful programs, shortcuts, boot modes, hacks; I wanted to start documenting the ones I find useful somewhere.
