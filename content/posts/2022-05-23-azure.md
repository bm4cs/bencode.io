## Intro

### Datacenters

- Much of the cloud runs on open-source software and hardware. Microsoft has been a member of [Open Compute Project](https://www.opencompute.org/) since 2014
- DC's in 58 regions.
- 2011 the Virginia site was purchase and complete in 2014 first modular design
- IT Pre-Assembled Components (ITPAC) were another innovation that speed up DC fitout
- _Project Olympus_ the next gen open-source rack level solution
- Azure sits on a mind-blowing dark fibre networking backbone; over 130,000 miles of cable, 160+ edge sites
- Huge investments in terrestrial and subsea cables; such as the [marea](https://news,microsoft.com/marea) project in collaboration with facebook (capacity of 200 Tbps per second!)

### Innovation

- Energy distribution results in ~5% loss
- Experiemental integrated full cells; which are in close proximity to racks
- [Project Natick](todo) explores underwater DC opportunities; early results in a PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) of 1.07 - the ratio of power delivered to power needed by computing equipment
- WUE (Water Usage Effectiveness) is litres per MW of power per minute
- Undersea designs have shown to improve equippment lifetimes by 700% and faster deployment (e.g. 90 days vs 18 months for a land-based build).
- Nitick equippment expected to live for 20 years
- Specialised hardware is now available; GPU's (huge core density for VDI, HPC workloads), FPGA's (field-programmable gate arrays - modern day breadboarding of reusable logic blocks) and ASIC's (hardware encoded algorithms)
- [Doug Burger](todo) technical fellow and world leading computing architecture researcher; the [EDGE]() architecture, [NUCA]() cache designs and the [TRIPS]() processor
- [Project Capapult](https://aka.ms/project-catapult) augments CPU's with an interconnected mesh of FPGA's
- FPGA's can be strong for processing workloads in parallel
- [SDN]() based networks were found to steal too many precious CPU instruction cycles; and was found to be a huge trade-off at scale; the packet processing layer of the SDN stack now occurs on FPGA's. This manifested as [Azure Accelerated Networking]()
- [Project Brainwave]() explores using FPGA's to encode the deep neural network ResNet50 mode model, custom train it, package and deploy it; object classification <1.8ms at a cost of 20 cents per million images
- [Project Sirius](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sirius/) cloud network traffic is expected to double every two years and is at odds with electrical network switches which may not continue to scale in line with Mooreâ€™s law. Project Sirius aims to develop an all-optical, data-center-wide network that is completely flat, in contrast to the hierarchy of electrical switches used today. By eliminating the inefficiencies of hierarchy and leveraging the strengths of optics, such a network could provide better and more predictable performance with higher reliability and at lower cost.

### Journey to cloud

- [Azure Global Infrastructure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/)
- [Azure Charts](https://www.azurecharts.com/) live visual exploration environment for Azure Cloud + ecosystem
- Geographies, regions and availablity zones
- Strategy is to build at least 2 regions per geography, to meet disaster recovery design goals; known as _paired regions_
- A region can contain many DC's (must achieve <2ms of network latency between DC's within a region)
- With current networking constraints, DC's must be within 100Km proximity
- A region that supports Availability Zones, will offer at least 3 AZ's
- An availability zone (AZ) is a unique physical location in a region, made up of 1+ DC's; with independent power, cooling and networking
- Azure region types:
  - Heros: complete portfolio of azure services (ring 0, 1 and 2), 3+ availability zones and unlimited growth capacity (>500MW)
  - Hubs: provides most highly consumed azure services (ring 0 and 1), 3+ availability zones and uncapped growth (>100MW)
  - Satellites: hidden from customer sight, are cross-regional disaster recovery and remote failover within a geography
- Service rings [product catalog ]
  - Ring 0: foundational (most popular 80% of in-geo use)
  - Ring 1: go global
  - Ring 2: limited; exception tier (peview, nagative return, depreciation)

## Azure Networking

Virutal network:

- Complete network can be materialised within Azure itself.
- Segmentation with subnets and security groups
- VLAN tags
- TCP/IP flows with explicit routes
- Custom DNS servers (e.g. 8.8.8.8) can be tied in at the VNET level
- DDoS services can be bound to the VNET
- Public IP address is an independent resource, which is later associated to either a load balancer or network interface
- NSG (Network Security Groups):
  - Get attached to a NIC or subnet
  - Used for segmentation such as DMZ's
  - Restricts only within the region it was created

Frontend access:

- Dynamic and reserved IP
- DNS plays a key role in more intelligently routing ingress traffic
- DNS is built-in in most cases (w.g. VM's)
- Traffic manager can be used to route clients based on their shortest path (e.g. US vs Europe)
- Load balancing
- DDoS protection

Backend connectivity:

- ExpressRoute for private enterprise-grade connectivity
- VPN
  - Point-to-site for dev/test
  - VPN gateways for secure site-to-site

PaaS services:

- They interconnect across the Azure backbone
- Granular access control defined with _service firewalls_

### Virtual Appliances

VMs that bolster Azure networking with additional powers; IDS, IPS, firewall, router, VPN, WAN optimisation.

- Typically run Linux or FreeBSD
- Often needed to satisfy IT policy and compliance
- Need to BYO licences

### Load Balancing

- Baked-in Azure Load Balancer basic and standard SKUs (layer 3 and 4)
  - Layer 3, 4 and 7 load balancing is available
  - Standard works across AZs
  - Supports TCP and UDP
  - Support health probes
  - NAT rules allow to address specific underlying VMs
- Application Gateway (layer 7)
  - Works with HTTP/HTTPS protocols only (session cookie affinity, SSL offloading, URL re-routing )
  - Small, medium and large SKUs
  - Web app firewall (WAF) available in medium/large SKUs, protects against range of common web attacks:
    - SQL injection
    - XSS
    - Protocol anomalies (missing agent or headers)
    - Bots, crawlers, scanners
    - Detects common misconfig (IIS, Nginx, Apache)
- 3rd party options in marketplace
  - TODO: examples

### Traffic Manager

DNS based traffic distribution

- Not dependent on a specific Azure region
- Four algorithms on offer; performance, weighted, priority (fail over), geographic
- Map domain `bencode.io` to `bencode-tm.trafficmanager.net`
- Re-direct traffic to any Internet facing endpoint
- Built-in HTTP/HTTPS probes for HA

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Rehost: lift and shift on IaaS
- Refactor: containerised
- Rearchitect: PaaS
- Rebuild: PaaS
- Replace: SaaS

Motiviation for IaaS:

- Security compliance; certain anti-AV, anti-amlware, SIEM agents
- Control; patching policies, auditing, logging, kernel tuning,
- Policy; no-vendor lock-in,

### Virtual Machines

Are available in a range of workload optimised configurations. Which SKU?

- Entry level; A series
- Burstable; B series
- General purpose; D series
- Compute intensive; F series
- Memory optimised; G/E/M series, intensive memory worksloads such as a redis cache, queues
- GPU; N series, NVIDIA CUDA workloads
- HPC; H series
- Storage optimised; L series, high I/O workloads such as databases

Virtual machine extensions:

- Provide a VM extensibilty point; for pre-baking security, configuration management (Ansible, Puppet DSC)
- The [Azure Desired State Configuration extension handler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/dsc-overview) for example can ensure a set of VMs:
  - Has IIS installed
  - Has ASP.NET 4.5 installed
  - The website bundle is copied to `wwwroot`
- [Custom VM extension example](https://github.com/hansenms/azure_templates)

#### Disks

VMs can have 1+ OS and/or data disks attached to them for persistence.

- By convention `D:` should always be considered as ephemeral (it is destroyed in a move or deallocation)
- Ultra SSD; offer upto 160,000 IOPS
- Premium SSD; 120 (P4) to 20,000 (P80) IOPS
- Standard SSD; 500 (E10) to 2,000 (E80) IOPS
- Standard HDD; dev/test workloads, no guarantees around IOPS or throughput

#### Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)

Enables the deployment of identical VM clones in minutes.

- Script based (can make unlimited number of VMs); such as PowerShell DSC or Ansible
- Disk image based (faster); a golden image

- Supports both scale-out (more VMs) and scale-up (beefier VMs) scenarios
- A VMSS can configured to automatically add more VMs if a threshold is triggered, such as CPU utilisation >80%
- Scaling can be triggered based on workload, for example the number of requests coming in
- A VM takes ~3mins to provision

#### Availability Sets (AS)

To improve resiliance and availability.

- Different VMs within the same AS, get physically deployed to different racks, providing a level of resilience (e.g. switch failure, storage failure)
- Can house up-to 100 VMs
- _Fault domains_ partition VMs for fault tolerance, with default of 2; for example at 2, VMs get assigned to either 0, 1 or 2 (about a 30% split up), if one of the FD's dies, you can expect to loose about 30% of VMs.
- _Update domains_ partition VMs for upgrades, default is 5

Availability maturity model:

- Single VM on premium storage; 99.9%
- Availability sets; protection against failures within DCs; 99.95%
- Availabilty zones; protected against entire DC failures; 99.99%
- Region pairs; protection from disaster with Data Residency compliance

## Tenants, Subscriptions and Organisations

_Tenant_; client that owns a specific instance of cloud service. When the identity platform by Microsoft a tenant is just a dedicated instance of AAD.

- It possible for an account to be a member of multiple directories.
- Switching directories as necessary, to get different tenant perspectives such as for consultants.

An _Organisation_ represents the business entity (customer) using Microsoft cloud offerings. It serves as a container for subscriptions.

A _Subscription_ represents the agreement to use various cloud platforms.

- Subscription by org structure (e.g. HR sub, IT sub)
- Non-prod subs (e.g. development, testing)
- Subscription level quotas can be enforced.
- Every subscription trusts one and only one AAD directory

The Microsoft Identity Platform can be consumed:

- ADAL (Active Directory Authentication Libraries), older on-premises libraries backed by traditional v1 endpoints or ADFS
- MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Libraries), backed by v2 endpoints, AAD, MSA or AAD B2C
- MSI (Managed Service Identity) allows an Azure resource to identity itself to AAD without presenting explicit creds, they are only involved in authn (not authz)
