## Intro

### Datacenters

- Much of the cloud runs on open-source software and hardware. Microsoft has been a member of [Open Compute Project](https://www.opencompute.org/) since 2014
- DC's in 58 regions.
- 2011 the Virginia site was purchase and complete in 2014 first modular design
- IT Pre-Assembled Components (ITPAC) were another innovation that speed up DC fitout
- _Project Olympus_ the next gen open-source rack level solution
- Azure sits on a mind-blowing dark fibre networking backbone; over 130,000 miles of cable, 160+ edge sites
- Huge investments in terrestrial and subsea cables; such as the [marea](https://news,microsoft.com/marea) project in collaboration with facebook (capacity of 200 Tbps per second!)

### Innovation

- Energy distribution results in ~5% loss
- Experiemental integrated full cells; which are in close proximity to racks
- [Project Natick](todo) explores underwater DC opportunities; early results in a PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) of 1.07 - the ratio of power delivered to power needed by computing equipment
- WUE (Water Usage Effectiveness) is litres per MW of power per minute
- Undersea designs have shown to improve equippment lifetimes by 700% and faster deployment (e.g. 90 days vs 18 months for a land-based build).
- Nitick equippment expected to live for 20 years
- Specialised hardware is now available; GPU's (huge core density for VDI, HPC workloads), FPGA's (field-programmable gate arrays - modern day breadboarding of reusable logic blocks) and ASIC's (hardware encoded algorithms)
- [Doug Burger](todo) technical fellow and world leading computing architecture researcher; the [EDGE]() architecture, [NUCA]() cache designs and the [TRIPS]() processor
- [Project Capapult](https://aka.ms/project-catapult) augments CPU's with an interconnected mesh of FPGA's
- FPGA's can be strong for processing workloads in parallel
- [SDN]() based networks were found to steal too many precious CPU instruction cycles; and was found to be a huge trade-off at scale; the packet processing layer of the SDN stack now occurs on FPGA's. This manifested as [Azure Accelerated Networking]()
- [Project Brainwave]() explores using FPGA's to encode the deep neural network ResNet50 mode model, custom train it, package and deploy it; object classification <1.8ms at a cost of 20 cents per million images
- [Project Sirius](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sirius/) cloud network traffic is expected to double every two years and is at odds with electrical network switches which may not continue to scale in line with Moore’s law. Project Sirius aims to develop an all-optical, data-center-wide network that is completely flat, in contrast to the hierarchy of electrical switches used today. By eliminating the inefficiencies of hierarchy and leveraging the strengths of optics, such a network could provide better and more predictable performance with higher reliability and at lower cost.

### Journey to cloud

- [Azure Global Infrastructure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/)
- [Azure Charts](https://www.azurecharts.com/) live visual exploration environment for Azure Cloud + ecosystem
- Geographies, regions and availablity zones
- Strategy is to build at least 2 regions per geography, to meet disaster recovery design goals; known as _paired regions_
- A region can contain many DC's (must achieve <2ms of network latency between DC's within a region)
- With current networking constraints, DC's must be within 100Km proximity
- A region that supports Availability Zones, will offer at least 3 AZ's
- An availability zone (AZ) is a unique physical location in a region, made up of 1+ DC's; with independent power, cooling and networking
- Azure region types:
  - Heros: complete portfolio of azure services (ring 0, 1 and 2), 3+ availability zones and unlimited growth capacity (>500MW)
  - Hubs: provides most highly consumed azure services (ring 0 and 1), 3+ availability zones and uncapped growth (>100MW)
  - Satellites: hidden from customer sight, are cross-regional disaster recovery and remote failover within a geography
- Service rings [product catalog ]
  - Ring 0: foundational (most popular 80% of in-geo use)
  - Ring 1: go global
  - Ring 2: limited; exception tier (peview, nagative return, depreciation)

## Azure Networking

Virutal network:

- Complete network can be materialised within Azure itself.
- Segmentation with subnets and security groups
- VLAN tags
- TCP/IP flows with explicit routes
- Custom DNS servers (e.g. 8.8.8.8) can be tied in at the VNET level
- DDoS services can be bound to the VNET
- Public IP address is an independent resource, which is later associated to either a load balancer or network interface
- NSG (Network Security Groups):
  - Get attached to a NIC or subnet
  - Used for segmentation such as DMZ's
  - Restricts only within the region it was created

Frontend access:

- Dynamic and reserved IP
- DNS plays a key role in more intelligently routing ingress traffic
- DNS is built-in in most cases (w.g. VM's)
- Traffic manager can be used to route clients based on their shortest path (e.g. US vs Europe)
- Load balancing
- DDoS protection

Backend connectivity:

- ExpressRoute for private enterprise-grade connectivity
- VPN
  - Point-to-site for dev/test
  - VPN gateways for secure site-to-site

PaaS services:

- They interconnect across the Azure backbone
- Granular access control defined with _service firewalls_

### Virtual Appliances

VMs that bolster Azure networking with additional powers; IDS, IPS, firewall, router, VPN, WAN optimisation.

- Typically run Linux or FreeBSD
- Often needed to satisfy IT policy and compliance
- Need to BYO licences

### Load Balancing

- Baked-in Azure Load Balancer basic and standard SKUs (layer 3 and 4)
  - Layer 3, 4 and 7 load balancing is available
  - Standard works across AZs
  - Supports TCP and UDP
  - Support health probes
  - NAT rules allow to address specific underlying VMs
- Application Gateway (layer 7)
  - Works with HTTP/HTTPS protocols only (session cookie affinity, SSL offloading, URL re-routing )
  - Small, medium and large SKUs
  - Web app firewall (WAF) available in medium/large SKUs, protects against range of common web attacks:
    - SQL injection
    - XSS
    - Protocol anomalies (missing agent or headers)
    - Bots, crawlers, scanners
    - Detects common misconfig (IIS, Nginx, Apache)
- 3rd party options in marketplace
  - TODO: examples

### Traffic Manager

DNS based traffic distribution

- Not dependent on a specific Azure region
- Four algorithms on offer; performance, weighted, priority (fail over), geographic
- Map domain `bencode.io` to `bencode-tm.trafficmanager.net`
- Re-direct traffic to any Internet facing endpoint
- Built-in HTTP/HTTPS probes for HA

## IaaS

- Rehost: lift and shift on IaaS
- Refactor: containerised
- Rearchitect: PaaS
- Rebuild: PaaS
- Replace: SaaS

Motiviation for IaaS:

- Security compliance; certain anti-AV, anti-amlware, SIEM agents
- Control; patching policies, auditing, logging, kernel tuning,
- Policy; no-vendor lock-in,

### Virtual Machines

Are available in a range of workload optimised configurations. Which SKU?

- Entry level; A series
- Burstable; B series
- General purpose; D series
- Compute intensive; F series
- Memory optimised; G/E/M series, intensive memory worksloads such as a redis cache, queues
- GPU; N series, NVIDIA CUDA workloads
- HPC; H series
- Storage optimised; L series, high I/O workloads such as databases

Virtual machine extensions:

- Provide a VM extensibilty point; for pre-baking security, configuration management (Ansible, Puppet DSC)
- The [Azure Desired State Configuration extension handler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/dsc-overview) for example can ensure a set of VMs:
  - Has IIS installed
  - Has ASP.NET 4.5 installed
  - The website bundle is copied to `wwwroot`
- [Custom VM extension example](https://github.com/hansenms/azure_templates)

#### Disks

VMs can have 1+ OS and/or data disks attached to them for persistence.

- By convention `D:` should always be considered as ephemeral (it is destroyed in a move or deallocation)
- Ultra SSD; offer upto 160,000 IOPS
- Premium SSD; 120 (P4) to 20,000 (P80) IOPS
- Standard SSD; 500 (E10) to 2,000 (E80) IOPS
- Standard HDD; dev/test workloads, no guarantees around IOPS or throughput

#### Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)

Enables the deployment of identical VM clones in minutes.

- Script based (can make unlimited number of VMs); such as PowerShell DSC or Ansible
- Disk image based (faster); a golden image

- Supports both scale-out (more VMs) and scale-up (beefier VMs) scenarios
- A VMSS can configured to automatically add more VMs if a threshold is triggered, such as CPU utilisation >80%
- Scaling can be triggered based on workload, for example the number of requests coming in
- A VM takes ~3mins to provision

#### Availability Sets (AS)

To improve resiliance and availability.

- Different VMs within the same AS, get physically deployed to different racks, providing a level of resilience (e.g. switch failure, storage failure)
- Can house up-to 100 VMs
- _Fault domains_ partition VMs for fault tolerance, with default of 2; for example at 2, VMs get assigned to either 0, 1 or 2 (about a 30% split up), if one of the FD's dies, you can expect to loose about 30% of VMs.
- _Update domains_ partition VMs for upgrades, default is 5

Availability maturity model:

- Single VM on premium storage; 99.9%
- Availability sets; protection against failures within DCs; 99.95%
- Availabilty zones; protected against entire DC failures; 99.99%
- Region pairs; protection from disaster with Data Residency compliance

## Tenants, Subscriptions and Organisations

_Tenant_; client that owns a specific instance of cloud service. When the identity platform by Microsoft a tenant is just a dedicated instance of AAD.

- It possible for an account to be a member of multiple directories.
- Switching directories as necessary, to get different tenant perspectives such as for consultants.

An _Organisation_ represents the business entity (customer) using Microsoft cloud offerings. It serves as a container for subscriptions.

A _Subscription_ represents the agreement to use various cloud platforms.

- Subscription by org structure (e.g. HR sub, IT sub)
- Non-prod subs (e.g. development, testing)
- Subscription level quotas can be enforced.
- Every subscription trusts one and only one AAD directory

The Microsoft Identity Platform can be consumed:

- ADAL (Active Directory Authentication Libraries), older on-premises libraries backed by traditional v1 endpoints or ADFS
- MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Libraries), backed by v2 endpoints, AAD, MSA or AAD B2C
- MSI (Managed Service Identity) allows an Azure resource to identity itself to AAD without presenting explicit creds, they are only involved in authn (not authz)



## PaaS

The upper pieces of the software stack, avoiding lower level concerns such as OS management, disk topologies, patching.

Designed to supports scalable, reliable and low-administration overhead applications.

- Pay-as-you-go 
- Pre-built application components that can be clipped together (object stores, caches, workflow, directory services, search)
- Azure offers two categories of PaaS; storage and compute related offerings. 

### Azure Storage

- *Azure Storage* a versatile solution that can handle a variety of workloadsqueues, blobs, structured, CIFS/SMB3 shares
- Durabillity options:
  - Locally Redundant Storage (LRS): 3x within a DC
  - Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS): 3x spread over DCs within a region
  - Geo-Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS): 3x spread over DCs in region AND 3x spread over DCs in another region
  - Read-Access Geographically Redundant Storage (RAGS!): read-access to secondary region copies

#### Blob storage

Large amount of unstructured data; large binary objects, documents, images...

- TODO: what are the upper bounds?
- Housed within containers
- Granular ACLs
- Exposed via REST APIs



#### Queues

Large scale queue. Yes a FIFO queue, async, decouple components, so on.

- TODO: what are the upper bounds?


#### File shares (SMB3, NFSv3, SFTP)

Surface storage as samba.

- SMB 3.0 only
- Ceiling is 100TiB
- TODO: what are the upper bounds?

#### Table

Don't think this is still relevant in 2022!? Cosmos, Kusto??

- NoSQL offering, no constrained by a set in stone schemas.
- Like mongo/elastic achieves this with sharding; uses partition keys.
- TODO: what are the upper bounds?

### CosmosDB

- Geo-distributed by design
- Low latency (<10ms) 99th percentile (P99)
- Supports the 5 types of consistency models (each trading amounts of latency, availability or throughput) **TODO: Cross check with DDIA Martin Kleppman**
  - Strong: linearisability guarantee, highly concurrent, reads return most recent committed version
  - Bounded-staleness: ordering based consistent-prefix guarantee, reads might lag behind writes at most a version
  - Session: widely used in single region and globally distribution, 
  - Consistent prefix: reads never see out of order writes
  - Eventual: the weakest form of consistency; no ordering guarentee for reads, in the absence of write activity replicas will evntually converge
- Mainstream APIs support; native table API, cassandra, SQL, mongodb, gremlin


### Relational Databases (Paas)

#### Azure SQL Databases (SQL Server)

- SQL Server PaaS.
- 99.99% availability
- Always latest patched version
- Low administration overheads
- Most of the awesome features and guarantees of SQL Server; ACID, TSQL, strong XML/JSON/graph support, security, audit, scale options, data protection
- Offers pre-provisioned and serverless hosting models:
  - For pre-provisioned can go with vCore-based or DTU-based
  - A *less demanding DTU-based* model only costs a few $ per month


#### Open-source engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB)

- PostgreSQL `<3`
- MySQL



### Compute PaaS

#### Azure App Services

A one-stop hosting service for web, APIs, mobile backends and/or serverless functions.

- Deployment models = code, container or static web
- Supported langs: .NET, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby
- Windows and Linux containers
- DevOps support; staging and deployment
- Certificate and secret management

##### Underlying resources

- App Service Plan, sits atop of a pool of pre-provisioned VMs
- App Service, on the other hand is lighter and runs code in a Docker container

Project [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki) is available at `http://app-services-uri/ZipDeployUI`. Kudu surfaces:

- Deployment functionality
- Debug consoles and dumps
- Process explorer
- Environment

##### Security

- MSI (Managed Service Identity) comes into play here for meshing into Azure Key Vault.
- Identity | System Assigned = On. This will assign a managed service principle.
- Back in Azure Key Vault, this principle by tied in using an Access Policy on the Vault. A handy principle picker is available there.
- Back in App Services, vault secrets like connection strings can be tied in using custom selector syntax `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=StorageAccountUri)`


##### Scale and observability

- Leverages [Geneva](TODO), the cloud scale observability platform
-
