[Peopleware](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67825.Peopleware) by Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister may just be the most important book on software engineering in existance.

# Managing humans

- The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature
- Most of us are appliers of other peoples work and inventions
- In reality were in the business of human communication
- Most managers approach software as mechanical process (make cheeseburger sell a cheeseburger)
- Systemising humans is a bad idea in programming
- Each human is unique and this should be celebrated (managers are often threatened by individuality)
- Someone who can help a project jell (a catalyst) is worth two that just do work
- Productivity ought to mean acheiving more in an hour of work, but too often has come to mean extracting more for an hour of pay
- Overtime is a myth. Ultimately it results in loss of respect for the manager.
- Anti-patterns organisations use to boost productivity; pressure more hours, mechanise processes, compromise quality, standardise procedures.
- Organisations dont keep statistics on turnover - virtually none can tell you what the replacement cost of an experienced worker is.
- The Eagle project at Data General used mostly underpaid overtime, burnt the entire development staff out, who all quit.
- People under time pressure don't work better, they just work faster.
