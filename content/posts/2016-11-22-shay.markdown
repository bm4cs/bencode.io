Some great wisdom imparted by Shay Banon (creator of Elasticsearch).

* Be bored. To promote innovation.
* Open source and building a critical mass. Be committed. You need to care for it now; IRC, forums, negative feedback, bugs.
* The benevolent dicator model (BDM) versus the democracy with a leader model.
* Be distributed.
* Choose a useful (and normally hard) problem to solve.
* Best way to learn is to actually build something.
* Double down on passion. Recruit passionate people (e.g. story about the guy who paid for Elastic training off his own back).
* Videos are for collaboration.
* Simple things, should be simple. Not easy though.
* Hierarchy matters. Humans can't make decisions in groups.
* IT is obsessed with whats next. You only need to look backwards for answers.
