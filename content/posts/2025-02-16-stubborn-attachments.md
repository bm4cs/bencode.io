_Stubborn Attachments_ is a book by _Tyler Cowen_ that paints a picture of an altruistic and bright future for the human race. Cohen argues and highlights the importance of sustained economic growth, moral philosophy and consequentialism, radical uncertainty, rules-based ethics, that future generations matter deeply, and how we as a race must be stubbornly attached to core principles as the necessary pre-conditions for sustainable prosperity.

## Overview

Cowen argues that long-term economic growth is the single most important factor that contributes to improving human welfare (1) under a form of moral philosophy and consequentialism he refers to as "wealth plus" utilitarianism, growth that values not just blind GDP but also leisure, environmental quality, and rights (2). Cohen then tackles the problem of uncertainty; our world and social fabric suffers from radical uncertainty; given the difficulty in precisely predicting the future (3) civilization has no choice but to follow simple, robust moral rules. He further ties off the problem of uncertainty, making the case that ethical decision-making should prioritise the well-being of future generations (4). Cohen concludes by arguing for commitment to free markets, rights, and rule of law as necessary conditions for sustainable prosperity.

## Supporting Arguments

1. TODO: historic medical and technological innovation, NZ and the iPhone
2. TODO
3. The epistemic critique (P103) suggests that the philisophic doctrine of consequentialism cannot be a useful guide to action because we hardly know anything about long-run consequences. "Can we have the correct moral theory if we cannot know 90% of what counts towards a good outcome?" (David Schmidtz). Most agree it's a good idea to teach teenager drives not to plough through yellow traffic lights. But when a driver stops at yellow lights instead of accelerating, they likely affect the length of others commute time thus changing the timing of millions of conceptions. Is there any way to truly tell if the _yellow light rule_ is a good one?
4. It is shocking how people respond when given a choice between the immediate present, the future and the distant future, which invariably focuses on teh immediate or nearby future.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Altruism

Acting for the benefit of others, sometimes at personal cost. Effective altruism, for example, applies evidence and reason to maximize the positive impact of charitable efforts. Cowen’s concern for future generations aligns with a long-term form of altruism.

### Epistemic

The relationship to knowledge. Often used in contexts like "epistemic humility" (recognising the limits of our knowledge) or "epistemic uncertainty" (acknowledging that we can never be fully certain about the future or complex systems). Cowen uses epistemic ideas to emphasize why we should be cautious and rules-based in decision-making.

### Nihilism

> What's the point of it all?

The belief that life lacks inherent meaning, value, or purpose. In philosophy, it can lead to moral nihilism (denying objective moral truths) or existential nihilism (doubting any ultimate purpose in life). Cowen contrasts this with the need for meaningful commitments to long-term values.

### Pluralism

The idea that multiple values or principles can coexist, sometimes conflicting, without a single overarching rule to resolve them. Moral pluralism means different ethical values (e.g., liberty, equality, and happiness) may all be important but cannot always be reduced to one another.

### Utilitarianism

A moral philosophy that judges actions based on their consequences, aiming to maximize overall happiness or well-being. Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill were key figures in its development. In Cowen’s context, he adapts utilitarianism to prioritise long-term economic growth and well-being he refers to as _Wealth Plus_.
