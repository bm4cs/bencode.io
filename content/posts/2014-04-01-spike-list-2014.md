I suffer from list syndrome. A condition where you constantly feel the urge to quickly scribble down ideas, and stuff your pockets with these little yellow crumpled up post-it notes...mine seem to focus on two main topics, [1] of all the cool ideas that randomly pop into my head, and [2] technology related things I want to spend my "free" time studying.

I really like the term "spike" coined back in the XP days:

  > "The purpose of a spike is to gain the knowledge necessary to reduce the risk of a technical approach, better understand a requirement, or increase the reliability of a story estimate."
