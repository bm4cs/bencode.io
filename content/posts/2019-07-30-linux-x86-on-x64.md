When you want to build and experiment with x86 (32-bit) based binaries on an x64 based linux kernel. This is often useful for reverse engineering and exploit proof of concepts, as x86 offers a number of simplicities over x64.

On Kali (or I assume anything else debian based) add overall subsystem support with:

    dpkg --add-architecture i386

Then to get a working development environment:

    apt update
    apt install libc-dev-i386-cross gdb-multiarch execstack gdb-peda lib32tinfo6 lib32ncurses6 lib32ncurses-dev gcc-7

You should be good to start compiling for an x86 target. Make sure to add `-m32` to any `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` parameters in the `Makefile`.

For example, to get a 32-bit build of ImageMagick, use the `configure` script with `CFLAGS` options to:

* add debug symbols with `ggdb`
* x86 with `m32`
* level 0 optimisations with `O0`

Like so:

    ./configure CXXFLAGS="-ggdb -m32 -O0" CFLAGS="-ggdb -m32 -fno-pie -O0"
    make -j 4

Wait a few minutes for the new build to finish, and verify it worked.
