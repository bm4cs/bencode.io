To provide a messaging infrastructure that will:

- Break the communication complexity problems associated with distributed software, such as the ability to deal with ongoing change, providing management mechanisms for the complex sea of distributed service interactions that typically take place in today’s IT environment.
- Provide reliable end-to-end messaging.
- Apply distributed software security.
- To provide a configurable, reusable architecture.
- Deal with common messaging problems generically—i.e. routing, transformation, exception handling and unification.
- Enforce consistency and unification.
- Leverage modern standards.
- Support legacy standards and interaction.
- Promote agility, through increased abstraction and loose coupling.
- Speed implementation turn-around, through configuration versus coding.
