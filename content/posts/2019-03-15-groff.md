*Update 2019-05-26*: While having some familarity with roff is useful, since the time of originally have discovered [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) which can convert between many document formats, such as from *markdown* to *roff*. Writing documentation in markdown is just hard to beat.

As the first text formatting program built for UNIX in 1970 running on a PDP-7, `roff` was a port of the BCPL program `RUNOFF`.

Over the years `roff` has evolved into `troff` and the excellent GNU version `groff`. Similar to other formatting systems, such as LaTeX, `groff` features a macro system, targetted at authoring certain types of text documents. In spite of its old age, `roff` is still in wide spread use today, for producing text such as UNIX manual pages, software books, system documentation and standards documents.

Compared to other text formatting systems, such as TeX, `groff` has a much smaller footprint (a complete LaTeX install can require several GB's), and my favourite feature is that plain-text output is treated as a first class citizen (such as a man pages). Also just like TeX, `groff` can do looseless output formats such as postscript and PDF.


* `ms` macros (`man groff_ms`) are suited to creating reports, letters and books.
* `man` macros (`man groff_man`) will craft man pages.
* `tmac`
* `mdoc`
* `me`
* `mm`
* `mmse`
* `mom`
* `www`




# Installation

Depending on your distro, there's a good chance a working `groff` system is already setup. On this Ubuntu 18 box I needed a:

    sudo apt install groff groff-base


# A tidy looking document (the ms macro set)

To get started, will take the *ms* macro set for a spin. Create a new text file `test.ms`:

    .TL
    My first groff document
    .AU
    Ben Simmonds
    .AI
    University of NSW
    .AB \"abstract start
    This is an abstract.
    .AE \"abstract end
    .NH
    Introduction
    .PP
    This is a paragraph.
    .PP
    And another paragraph.
    .NH
    Background
    .NH 2
    The why
    .PP
    Some more text, this is 
    .B "bold"
    ta da, and this
    .I "italic"
    boom.


The document has a title (TL), author (AU), institution (AI) and paragraph (PP).

Time to compile it:

    $ groff -ms test.ms

By default `groff` will dump postscript to stdout:

    %!PS-Adobe-3.0
    %%Creator: groff version 1.22.3
    %%CreationDate: Fri Mar 15 02:39:20 2019
    %%DocumentNeededResources: font Times-Bold
    %%+ font Times-Italic
    %%+ font Times-Roman
    ...

This could be redirected into a `ps` file, or alternatively `groff` can just produce a PDF with the `-T` option:

    $ groff -ms groff.ms -T pdf > groff.pdf


Sample document in a PDF viewer:

# A humble man page (the man macro set)

While there is some similarity to using the *ms* macro as in the document example above, the *man* macro set does introduce some specific character sequences. Check `man groff_man` to get an awesome cheat sheet.

Here's an old example (from 1995), source [https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1158](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1158):

    .TH COFFEE 1 "23 March 94"
    .SH NAME
    coffee \- Control remote coffee machine
    .SH SYNOPSIS
    \fBcoffee\fP [ -h | -b ] [ -t \fItype\fP ]
    \fIamount\fP
    .SH DESCRIPTION
    \fBcoffee\fP queues a request to the remote
    coffee machine at the device \fB/dev/cf0\fR.
    The required \fIamount\fP argument specifies
    the number of cups, generally between 0 and
    12 on ISO standard coffee machines.
    .SS Options
    .TP
    \fB-h\fP
    Brew hot coffee. Cold is the default.
    .TP
    \fB-b\fP
    Burn coffee. Especially useful when executing
    \fBcoffee\fP on behalf of your boss.
    .TP
    \fB-t \fItype\fR
    Specify the type of coffee to brew, where
    \fItype\fP is one of \fBcolumbian\fP,
    \fBregular\fP, or \fBdecaf\fP.
    .SH FILES
    .TP
    /fC/dev/cf0\fR
    The remote coffee machine device
    .SH "SEE ALSO"
    milk(5), sugar(5)
    .SH BUGS
    May require human intervention if coffee
    supply is exhausted.

The `groff_man` man page is the best resource, but a quick breakdown:

* `.TH` sets the main title of the man page
* `.SH` defines a level 1 section header. A convention for man pages is to provide the sections *NAME*, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, FILES, SEE ALSO, NOTES, AUTHOR, and BUGS, with extra sections as needed.
* `.SS` defines a subsection
* `.TP` is used to define a tagged list, and is used to enumerate the available command line options. The line immediately after `.TP` is the tag.
* `\fB`, `\fI` and `\fR` set bold, italic and roman type.
* `\fP` returns the font to its previous mode


To compile, run groff with the `ascii` type and set the `man` macro set like so:

    $ groff -Tascii -man coffee.man | less


You should see a neatly formatted man page (the following does not include the bold and italic font settings):

    COFFEE(1)                   General Commands Manual                  COFFEE(1)

           coffee  queues  a  request  to  the remote coffee machine at the device
           /dev/cf0.  The required amount argument specifies the number  of  cups,
           generally between 0 and 12 on ISO standard coffee machines.

                  of your boss.
    
           -t type
                  Specify the type of  coffee  to  brew,  where  type  is  one  of
                  columbian, regular, or decaf.
    
    FILES
           /fC/dev/cf0

    BUGS
           May require human intervention if coffee supply is exhausted.



                                  23 March 94                        COFFEE(1)


Next, to install the freshly baked manual into the system man page store.

    $ sudo cp coffee.man /usr/share/man/man1/coffee.1

Rebuild the man pages index:

    $ sudo mandb

The man page can now be viewed as one would expect:

    $ man coffee

Also, the new *coffee* man page should be searchable by tools like `apropos`:

    $ apropos coff
    coffee (1)           - Control remote coffee machine
