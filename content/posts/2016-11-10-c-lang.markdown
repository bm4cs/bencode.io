## Philosophy

Rob Pike's 5 Rules of Programming [Source](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html)

1. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.
2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.
3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first)
4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.
5. Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.

Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare's famous maxim

> Premature optimization is the root of all evil

Ken Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as

> When in doubt, use brute force

Rule 5 was previously stated by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month

> write stupid code that uses smart objects

# Grammar

## Basic Types

### Integer Types

C99 with `stdbool.h` introduced boolean type `_Bool` (1 byte), and macros `true` (1) and `false` (0).

| Type                    | Storage (bytes) |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| `_Bool`                 | 1               |
| `char`                  | 1               |
| `unsigned char`         | 1               |
| `signed char`           | 1               |
| `int`                   | 2-4             |
| `unsigned int`          | 2-4             |
| `short`                 | 2               |
| `unsigned short`        | 2               |
| `long`                  | 4               |
| `unsigned long`         | 4               |
| `long long(*)`          | 8               |
| `unsigned long long(*)` | 8               |

Interestingly the specific storage size for `int` is not defined. A compilers given implementation bit widths are defined in `limits.h`.

### Real and Complex Floating Types

Most compilers honour the IEEE 754-1985 standard.

| Type          | Storage (bytes) | Precision (decimal) |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| `float`       | 4               | 6                   |
| `double`      | 8               | 15                  |
| `long double` | 10              | 19                  |

### void

Represents no value, and is widely used in three scenarios:

1. Functions that do not return a value, e.g. `void exit (int status)`, or where the return value is to be explicitly discarded e.g. `(void)printf("mt tennent");`
2. Prototypes of functions that have no parameters, e.g. `int rand(void)`
3. Pointers to void i.e. `void *` (typeless pointers)

## Memory Access Operators

The **address of** operator, `&`, yields the address of its subject, thus `&foo` is a pointer to `foo`.

The **indirection** operator, `*`, is used to access an object or function through a pointer.

{% highlight c %}
int32_t num, *pnum;
pnum = &num;
*pnum = 123;
{% endhighlight %}

The **subscript operator**, `[]`, can be used to address elements within an array. In reality this is sugar for offsetting into chunk of memory, or in other words `x[i]` is equivalent to `(*(x+(i)))`

{% highlight c %}
float arr[10] = { 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 }, \*parr;
parr = arr;
parr = parr + 3;
{% endhighlight %}

Member of a struct or union operators, `.`, and its pointer friendly version `->`. The arrow operator `->` is a convenient pointer dereference. That is, `p->x` is equivalent to `(*p).x`

{% highlight c %}
struct { wchar_t *name; float amount; } label, *plabel;
label.amount = 49.95;
plabel = &label;
plabel->name = "Bill Joy";
{% endhighlight %}

## Strings

## The Pre Processor

### Macros

This following macro is called variadic. When the macro is invoked, all the tokens in its argument list after the last named argument, including any commas, become the variable argument. This sequence of tokens replaces the identifier `__VA_ARGS__` in the macro body wherever it appears.

{% highlight c %}
#define stopif(assertion, action, ...) {
if (assertion) {
fprintf(error_log ? error_log : stderr, **VA_ARGS**);
fprintf(error_log ? error_log : stderr, "\n");
action;
} }

//usage
stopif(!isnan(inv_total), goto nanval, "Invoice amount was NaN");
stopif(!foo, return -1, "wtf dude, foo must not be NULL");

nanval:
free(fooheap);
return NAN;
{% endhighlight %}

Another one. The macro `print_log` acts as the public API, encapsulating internal grunt function `_print_log`:

{% highlight c %}
#define print_log(level, ...) do {
time_t \_clk = time(NULL);
\_print_log(level, **FILE**, **func**, ctime(&\_clk), **LINE**, **VA_ARGS**);
} while (0)

extern void \_print*log(int, char *, const char \_, char*, int, char *, ...);

//usage
print_log(LOG_WARNING, "where be a wookie when you need one");
{% endhighlight %}

# Patterns

## vtables

Virtual tables are a technique for adding functions outside of an objects struct. Using a hash table as the vtable data structure, the key, something unique to the object and the specific function (in case you want to store multiple functions in the vtable for the same object), and the value, the actual function.

### person_s.h

```c
typedef struct person_s {
    char *name;
    char **books;
    int len;
    void (*print)(struct person_s*);
};
```

The object, a person. The `print` function pointer here is souly used as the hash key. It's unique to both the object, and the specific operation of printing. It never points to an actual function.

### print_vtable.h

```c
extern HashTable *funcs_hash;

typedef void (_print_fn_type)(struct person_s_);

void check_print_fn(print_fn_type pf);

#define printfn_vtable_add(object, fn) { \
 check_print_fn(fn); \
 hash_table_insert(funcs_hash, (object)->print, fn); \
}

void print_person_frontend(struct person_s \*in);
```

Declares hash table, a macro to add functions to the hash table (this exists only to add static type checking on the function passed, by first trying to pass it into `check_print_fn`), and the "frontend" function signature (for consumers of the API) that takes in a person and will query the vtable for the function to invoke.

### print_vtable.c

```c
HashTable *funcs_hash;

void check_print_fn(print_fn_type pf) { }

void print_person_frontend(struct person_s \*in) {
    if (!funcs_hash) {
        funcs_hash = hash_table_new(g_direct_hash, g_direct_equal);
    }

    print_fn_type printfn = hash_table_lookup(funcs_hash, in->print);

    if (printfn) {
        printfn(in);
        return;
    }

    printf("No print implementation found in vtable...panic!\n");
}
```

### main.c

```c
static void print_person_backend(struct person_s \*in) {
    printf("\nName: %s\n", in->name);
    for (int i=0; i < in->len; i++)
    printf("- Book author for: %s\n", in->books[i]);
}

int main() {
    struct person_s dennis = {
        .name="Dennis Ritchie",
        .books = (char\*[]) { "The C Programming Language - 1978" },
        .len = 1
    };

    print_person_frontend(&dennis);
    printfn_vtable_add(&dennis, print_person_backend);
    print_person_frontend(&dennis);

    struct person_s rob = {
         .name = "Rob Pike",
        .books = (char*[]) { "The Unix Programming Environment - 1982", "The Practice of Programming - 1999" },
        .len = 2
    };
    print_person_frontend(&rob);

    return 0;

}
```

Output:

```
No print implementation found in vtable...panic!

## Libraries

The [C standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) and the [C POSIX library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_POSIX_library) both offer a standardised, resuable slabs of macros, type definitions and functions for tasks such as string handling, mathematical computations, input/output processing, memory management, and several common operating system services. A set of common building blocks.

POSIX being a superset of the C standard library. If C and POSIX is ever in conflict, C wins.

### Unit Testing

-   [Unity Project](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity/) - Unity is most obviously about assertions. Assertions are statements of what we expect to be true about our embedded system.
