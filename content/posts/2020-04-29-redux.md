Once you start working with [React]({{< ref 2019-05-05-react.md >}}) in anger, there is a tipping point to be aware of where:

- the complexity of data flows piles up
- the same data is being rendered in multiple places
- the number of state changes blow out

Being able to tackle these problems in a single place is where Redux fits in.

# The Problem

Imagine a fairly deep component hierarchy, starting with your top level `App` component. Deep down the tree, there are two child components that need to access a common piece of data (e.g. customer data). How should these components access the data they require?

## Option 1 lift the state

This option involves placing the state (customer data) to the common ancestor in the component tree. In the worst case, this could be the top level component. It then becomes the burden of each decendent component to pass this state down as `props` (known as props drilling).

In a large app, this sucks.

- keeping track of what props are being passed around
- introducing new components between an existing _prop drilling_ path

## Option 2 react context

React context exposes global data and functions from a given React component. To access this published state, a downstream component imports the context and consumes.

The common ancestor parent component, could publish customer data (and functions if desired) via `CustomerContext.Provider`.

The child components could consume this data via `CustomerContext.Consumer`.

## Option 3 Redux

Provides a centralised _store_ (like a local client side DB).

Any component can connect and query the _store_.

To change (mutate) data in the store is not directly possible. Instead the requesting component dispatches an action, for example _Create Customer_, and the data is eventually updated/created. Any components connected to this data, automatically receieve it's freshest version.

# Container vs Presentation Components

Container (aka smart, stateful or controller view) components can be thought of as the _backend of the frontend_. They're concerned with behaviour and marshalling. They're typically stateful, as they aim to keep the child components fresly rendered with the latest data. A good container component should have very minimal (ideally zero) markup.

Presentation (dumb, stateless or view) components are purely concerned with markup, and contain almost no logic. They are dumb.

| **Container**              | **Presentation**                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| How things work            | How things look                       |
| No markup                  | All markup                            |
| Stateful                   | Stateless                             |
| Aware of Redux             | Unaware of Redux                      |
| Pass data and actions down | Receive data and actions with `props` |
| Subscribe to Redux state   | Read data from `props`                |
| Dispatch Redux actions     | Invoke callbacks on `props`           |

# The Redux Principles

1. One immutable store. It cant be changed directly. Immutability aids debugging, supports server rendering, and opens up the ability to easily centralise state functionality such as undo and redo.
2. Actions trigger changes. Components that wish to change state, do so by _dispatching_ an action.
3. State changes are handled by pure functions, known as _reducers_.

Conceptually this is publish subscribe. The redux flow visually:

    +---------+
    | ACTION  |
    +----+----+
         |
         v
    +----+----+       +-----------+
    |  STORE  +<----->+  REDUCER  |
    +----+----+       +-----------+
         |
         v
    +----+----+
    |  REACT  |
    +---------+

## Actions

An action represents the intent via its `type` property, the only mandatory field. Other data can be encoded into the action however you please.

    { type: RATE_GYM, rating: 4 }

In this example, rating could be a complex object, a boolean, or there could be several more properties in addition to rating.

Typically actions are made with a factory method known as an _action creator_:

    rateGym(rating) {
      return { type: RATE_GYM, rating: rating }
    }

This is good practice as the consuming components don't need to know about the internals of action structures. For each entity type, its common to have a CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) set of _action creators_.

## The Store

A store is created in the entry point of your application (i.e. as it starts up):

    let store = createStore(reducer);

The store API is suprisingly simple:

- `store.dispatch(action)`
- `store.subscribe(listener)`
- `store.getState()`
- `replaceReducer(nextReducer)`

## Immutability

A cornerstone principle of redux, is that state is never modified (mutated), instead a completely new copy of the data is returned.

Benefits of immutable state:

- **Clarity** around what is responsible for state changes, everything has a clearly defined reducer. No more debugging trying to track down the piece of code responsible for mutating the state.
- **Performance** the job of Redux determining if a state change has occured and notifying React is greatly simplified with an immutable store. Instead of doing complex field level comparisons of each data element before and after, all Redux needs to do is a `prevStoreState !== storeState` check.
- **Unrivalled debugging** because state is never mutated, allows for some incredible innovation in the debugging experience, such as time-travel debugging, undo/redo, skipping individual state actions, replaying the state interactions back. The redux devtools extensions opens this up.

Building complex objects up by hand each time a modification is needed, is not practical. JS does provide a number of ways to copy an object:

- Object.assign shallow copy. `Object.assign({}, state, { role: 'admin' })` assigns a new empty object based on the existing `state` object, after mixing-in the new `role` property.
- The spread operator, whatever is placed on the right is shallow copied `const newState = { ...state, role: 'admin' }`
- Immuatable friendly Array methods, such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `concat` and `spread`. Avoid `push`, `pop` and `reverse` which mutate.

There is a large ecosystem of libraries available (immer, seamless-immutable, react-addons-update, Immutable.js) for working with data in an immutable compatable way, one popular option is [immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer):

> Create the next immutable state tree by simply modifying the current tree

```javascript
import produce from "immer";

const user = {
  name: "Benjamin",
  address: {
    state: "New South Wales",
  },
};

const userCopy = produce(user, (draftState) => {
  draftState.address.state = "Victoria";
});

console.log(user.address.state); // New South Wales
console.log(userCopy.address.state); // Victoria
```

Options for enforcing immutability:

1. Trust the development team, through training and coding practices.
2. Warn whenever state is mutated using `redux-immutable-state-invariant` (only use in development!)
3. Enforce with the use of a library such as immer, immutable.js or seamless-immutable.

## Reducers

An action is eventually handled by a reducer. Metaphorically the reducer is the meat grinder of Redux, state goes in, state comes out.

    function myReducer(state, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case "INCREMENT_COUNTER":
          //state.counter++; //BAD: never mutate
          //return state;
          return { ...state, counter: state.counter + 1 };
        default:
          return state;
      }
    }

If and when the state is returned by a reducer, the store is updated.

Reducers must be pure. In other words a reducer must:

- Never mutate state
- Perform side effects, such as API calls or routing transitions
- Call non-pure functions (e.g. `Date.now`, `Math.random()`)

Therefore for a given input, and reducer is guaranted to alway return the same output.

When a dispatch is submitted, ALL reducers are invoked. That's why its important for the untouched `state` to be returned as the default case of the switch statement.

A reducer should be independent and responsible for updates to a slice of state, however there are no hard and fast rules.

Each action can be handled by one or more reducers.

Each reducer can handle multiple actions.

Any React components that a glued up to the store are automatically updated, via a push notification using React-Redux.

# React-Redux

Redux isn't exclusive to React. With React-Redux, can tie React components to state in the Redux store.

Two problems it solves:

- Attaching the app to the redux store (using a `Provider` component)
- Creating container components (using the `Connect` function)

## React-Redux Provider

Wrapping the root `App` component in a provider opens up the Redux store to every component in your application.

```javascript
<Provider store={this.props.store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

## React-Redux Connect

Before a container component is exported in the usual fashion, to connect it to the Redux store, it is wrapped with the `connect` function like so:

```javascript
function mapStateToProps(state, ownProps) {
  return { authors: state.authors };
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(AboutPage);
```

### mapStateToProps

`mapStateToProps` defines what state needs to be exposed as `props`.

It returns an object that defines the data of interest. Each property defined on the object magically becomes a `prop` on React component. Anytime this data changes in the store, Redux will automatically fire `mapStateToProps`.

The more specific you can be in `mapStateToProps` is a performance win, as it will cut down on the number of possible state change notifications Redux needs to manage.

**Important** everytime the component is updated, the `mapStateToProps` function is called. Eeek. If there is some heavy lifting going on, such as transforming or sorting a large data structure, consider _memoization_ (like caching for functions), where if the exact same state is presented as previously done, you can simply re-use the previously calculated results.

Memoizing libraries, called _selectors_, like [reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) exist to make this fun.

What do selectors bring to the table?

- They are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
- The can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
- They are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.

Here's one in action:

```javascript
const getAllCoursesSelector = (state) => state.courses;

export const getCoursesSorted = createSelector(
  getAllCoursesSelector,
  (courses) => {
    return [...courses].sort((a, b) =>
      a.title.localeCompare(b.title, "en", { sensitivity: "base" })
    );
  }
);
```

### mapDispatchToProps

How you expose redux actions to your components.

`mapDispatchToProps` defines what actions do I want on `props`. It receives `dispatch` as its lone parameter, and returns the callback props you want to pass down.

```javascript
function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return {
    actions: bindActionCreators(actions, dispatch),
  };
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(AboutPage);
```

Four ways to deal with `mapDispatchToProps`:

**Option 1**: Simply ignore it (i.e. dont declare it in the call to `connect`), and use the implicitly created `props.dispatch` function directly in your component.

    this.props.dispatch(loadProducts());

**Option 2**: Manually wrap calls to dispatch:

```javascript
function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return {
    loadProducts: () => {
      dispatch(loadProducts));
    },
    createProduct: (product) => {
      dispatch(createProduct(product));
    }
  }
}
```

To consume an action in the component becomes quite clean:

    this.props.loadProducts();

**Option 3**: Use `bindActionCreators`

This ships with redux, and takes an array of actions. It will wrap each of them in a call to dispatch for you.

```javascript
function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
  return {
    actions: bindActionCreators(actions, dispatch),
  };
}
```

**Option 4**: Return objects

Declare `mapDispatchToProps` as an object, as opposed to a map. Redux `connect` will automatically wrap each action creator in dispatch.

```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = {
  incrementCounter,
};
```

# A chat with redux

This dialogue from [@housecor](https://twitter.com/housecor) helps drive all the moving pieces home:

- **React**: Hey CourseAction, someone clicked this "Save Course" button.
- **Action**: Thanks React! I will dispatch an action so reducers that care can update state.
- **Reducer**: Ah, thanks action. I see you passed me the current state and the action to perform. I'll make a new copy of the state and return it.
- **Store**: Thanks for updating the state reducer. I'll make sure that all connected components are aware.
- **React-Redux**: Thanks for the new data Store. I'll determine if I should tell React about this change so that it only has to bother with updating the UI when necessary.
- **React**: Ooo! Shiny new data has been passed down via props from the store! I'll update the UI to reflect this!

# Redux Setup

Initial setup is full on:

1. Create action
2. Create reducer
3. Create root reducer
4. Configure store
5. Instantiate store
6. Connect component
7. Pass props via connect
8. Dispatch action

But once the foundation is setup, adding features becomes much easier:

1. Create action
2. Enhance reducer
3. Connect component
4. Dispatch action

# Async and APIs

Often state will come from another source, like the server. It's a good idea to kick off with a mock API. Why:

- can get started immediately with getting bogged down in backend
- is resilient to backend development instabilities
- simulate and test high latency (i.e. slowness)
- testing
- seamless bind to the real API by just tweaking the imports at the top of thunks/sagas, or checking an environment variable to toggle between mock and real API.

For a simple mock API, checkout the top level `tools` directory:

- `apiServer.js` a node mock API build using express and json-server, that reads in data from `db.json`
- `mockData.js` javascript data structures, exported in commonjs format (for node)
- `createMockDb.js` writes mock data to a file `db.json`

## Redux Middleware

An extensibility option for redux.

    +--------+     +------------+     +---------+
    | Action +---->+ Middleware +---->+ Reducer |
    +--------+     +------------+     +---------+

A convenient place to hook behaviour onto actions, such as:

- Logging
- Handling API calls
- Crash reporting
- Routing

Here's an example logger. The signature chains blocks of middleware together, using a technique called currying.

```javascript
const logger = store => next => action {
  console.group(action.type)
  console.info('dispatching', action)
  let result = next(action)
  console.log('next state', store.getState())
  console.groupEnd()
  return result
}
```

Reason to use middleware for async:

1. Consistency, without middleware the signature of the dispatch calls would vary depending if they were synchronous or asynchronous.
2. Purity, avoids binding code to side-effects.
3. Testing, components free of side-effects are easier to test.

## Redux Async Libraries

- `redux-thunk` by Dan Abramov (creator of redux) returns functions from action creator instead of objects.
- `redux-promise` uses promises paired with flux standard actions
- `redux-observable` dispatches RxJS observables
- `redux-saga` a full blown async DSL based on ES6 generators

## Thunks

Coined from compsci, a _thunk_ is just a function that wraps an expression to defer its evalutation.

In this case the call to dispatch is being deferred:

```javascript
export function deleteVehicle(vehicleId) {
  return (dispatch, getState) => {
    return VehicleApi.deleteVehicle(vehicleId)
      .then(() => {
        dispatch(deletedVehicle(vehicleId));
      })
      .catch(handleError);
  };
}
```

Redux thunks get some built-in power:

- Can access to the store.
- Are passed a hook to `dispatch`
- Passed `getState`, allows any conditional check against state (e.g. logged in user) before dispatching (i.e. a conditional dispatch)
-
