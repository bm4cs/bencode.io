A survey of the standard and high quality programs that feature in most Unix based distributions, with the GNU variants being my favourite. The [bash]({% post_url 2016-05-01-bash %}) shell is a great way of interfacing and orchestrating these beautifully crafted programs. As a starting point, I've listed out each utility offered by the amazing [GNU Core Utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html) and [util-linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Util-linux) umbrella projects; considered defacto standard on most distributions.

# Finding Documentation

## Manual Pages

The infamous manual (man) page documentation system. Man pages are organised by the following sections:

Section | Name | Description
--- | --- | ---
1 | User commands (Programs) | Commands that can be executed by the user from within a shell.
2 | System calls | Functions which wrap operations performed by the kernel.
3 | Library calls | Library functions excluding the system call wrappers (Most of the libc functions).
4 | Special files (devices) | Files found in `/dev` which allow to access to devices through the kernel.
5 | File formats and configuration files | Various human-readable file formats and configuration files.
6 | Games | Games and funny little programs available on the system.
7 | Overview, conventions, and miscellaneous | Various topics, conventions and protocols, character set standards, the standard filesystem layout, and miscellaneous other things.
8 | System management commands | Commands like `mount(8)`, many of which only root can execute.


An explicit section can be requested. For the man page relating to the file format of `/etc/passwd`

    man 5 passwd

The `-k` switch is great for searching across `man`'s treasure chest of documentation. For example, say you want to set the system time, but have no idea what program to use to achieve this. Use the `-k` switch to scan documentation for *time*.


    $ man -k time
    ac (1)               - print statistics about users connect time
    adjtime (3)          - correct the time to synchronize the system clock
    adjtimex (2)         - tune kernel clock
    after (n)            - Execute a command after a time delay
    aio_suspend (3)      - wait for asynchronous I/O operation or timeout
    asctime (3)          - transform date and time to broken-down time or ASCII
    asctime (3p)         - convert date and time to a string

The lions share of search results seems to come from section 2 and 3 (C kernel and library calls). Focusing on the task at hand, administering the system time, lets filter results to man sections 1 (user commands) and 8 (system management commands).

    $ man -k time | grep -Pe '.*\([1,8]\).*'
    ac (1)               - print statistics about users connect time
    booleans (8)         - Policy booleans enable runtime customization of SELinux policy
    ccrewrite (1)        - Rewrite CLR assemblies for runtime code contract verification.
    chrt (1)             - manipulate the real-time attributes of a process
    date (1)             - print or set the system date and time
    dnssec-settime (8)   - Set the key timing metadata for a DNSSEC key
    jack_showtime (1)    - The JACK Audio Connection Kit example client

The `date` program looks perfect.


## Appropriate Commands

Basically an equivalent to the `man -k` switch for searching.

    $ apropos clock
    adjtime (3)          - correct the time to synchronize the system clock
    adjtimex (2)         - tune kernel clock
    alarm (2)            - set an alarm clock for delivery of a signal
    clock (3)            - determine processor time


## whatis

For a very brief overview of a man page matching a keyword.

    $ whatis vim
    vim (1)              - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor

## GNU Info Entry

A purpose built documentation system from GNU, `info` features hyperlinks (prefixed with `*`), aimed at dealing with larger documentation sets than `man`.

`info` goes against the grain in terms of keyboard navigation. Its odd. Page up, page down, `enter` to follow a link, and `l` to go back,

Some keys for driving info:

- `n` next node
- `p` previous node
- `u` parent node
- `t` top node
- `home` `end` `pgup` `pgdn` scroll content
- `l` go back
- `q` quit
- `H` keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet


Searching info:

    $ info --apropos=tee
    "(coreutils)tee invocation" -- tee
    "(libc)Control Functions" -- feupdateenv
    "(gawk)Tee Program" -- 'tee' utility

And then `info gawk tee` for example to pull up the third result.



## /usr/share/doc Documentation

A gold mine of documents and sample configuration files. Usually for distributions that are not considered core, and don't offer man or info pages.



## RPM bundled documentation

    $ rpm -qd tmux
    /usr/share/doc/tmux/CHANGES
    /usr/share/doc/tmux/FAQ
    /usr/share/doc/tmux/TODO
    /usr/share/man/man1/tmux.1.gz




# Examples


## grep ##

[grep](http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html) prints lines that contain a match for a pattern.

Useful modes:

- `-r` or `-R` for recursive
- `-n` show line number
- `-w` match the whole word
- `-v` invert match (i.e. blacklist)
- `-l` just give the file name of matching files
- `-i` case insensative
- `-P` Perl style regular expressions

Recursively search all files from the current directory, containing *Romero*, including the line number where they are found:

{% highlight bash %}
$ grep -rnw . -e 'Romero'
Binary file ./datatsudio/.metadata/.plugins/seg0/c530.dat matches
./files/diff/heros_new:4:Romero,John,671028
./files/heros:7:Romero,John,671028
{% endhighlight %}

The `--include` and `--exclude` are very useful for filtering target files, and the amount of work grep needs to do. Exclude `*.dat` binary files from the above example:

{% highlight bash %}
$ grep -rnw . -e 'Romero' --exclude '*.dat'
./grep/diff/heros_new:4:Romero,John,671028
./grep/heros:7:Romero,John,671028
{% endhighlight %}

Perl patterns:

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo "2016-10-13" | grep -Pe '\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}'
2016-10-13
{% endhighlight %}

Color highlight numeric 0 to 5:

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo "2016-10-13" | grep --color '[0-5]'
2016-10-13
{% endhighlight %}

Overall total of how many times an expression matches:

{% highlight bash %}
$ grep -rnwo . --include \*.bash --include \*.sh -e 'BASH_REMATCH' | wc -l
12
{% endhighlight %}



## cut ##

Removes portions from each line of input. By default will use standard input, when no `FILE` specified, or when FILE is `-`.

Select the first field for the colon delimitered file `/etc/passwd`.

    $ cut -d : -f 1 /etc/passwd
    LocalService
    NetworkService
    Guest
    SYSTEM


Hack just the date portion (chars 1-10) off the front of logs, and show the unique dates:

    $ cut -c1-10 dircdds.log | grep -Pe '\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}' | sort -h | uniq
    2016-03-21
    2016-03-22
    2016-03-24
    2016-03-29
    2016-04-21



## sort ##

By default will sort in dictionary order.

    $ cut -d : -f 3 /etc/passwd | sort
    0
    1
    1000
    1001
    107
    11
    113
    12

Useful sort modes:

- `-h` human numeric (e.g. 2K 3G)
- `-n` numeric
- `-r` reverse
- `-R` random
- `-u` unique



## tr ##

For translating (e.g. uppercasing, stripping, truncating, etc) text.

Convert lower case characters to upper.

    $ echo "Linus Torvalds" | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]
    LINUS TORVALDS

Make all lower case characters `o`:

    $ echo "Linus Torvalds" | tr [:lower:] o
    Loooo Tooooooo

Replace the range of characters `a` to `o`, with `@`:

    $ echo "Linus Torvalds" | tr a-o @
    L@@us T@rv@@@s



## wc ##

Count aggregates of the contents of a file.

By default will show counts of lines, words and bytes.

    $ wc pthreads.make 
    7  29 252 pthreads.make


Useful counts:

- `-l`, `--lines` newlines
- `-w`, `--words` words
- `-c`, `--bytes` bytes
- `-m`, `--chars` characters

Just show the number of lines:

    $ wc -l pthreads.make 
    7  pthreads.make

Pipe support just works:

    $ cat 2016-05-01-bash.markdown | wc -l
    1100



## tar ##

The rock solid archiving tool that you can always lean on.

Create an archive of all of the `/etc` directory:

    tar -cvf etcy.tar /etc 2> /dev/null

- `-c` create mode
- `-v` verbose list each file that gets processed
- `-f` the tar file being delt with


Same, with compression:

    tar -czf etcy.tar.gz /etc 2> /dev/null

- `-z` (gzip) or `-j` (bzip2) compression

Example compression sizes:

     28M etcy.tar
    4.4M etcy.tar.bz2
    5.6M etcy.tar.gz


Whats in this tarball? `-t` or `--list` has answers:

    tar -tf etcy.tar
    etc/
    etc/idmapd.conf
    etc/openldap/
    etc/openldap/ldap.conf
    ...

Unpack the entire tar:

    tar -xf etcy.tar


Unpack specific things:

    tar -xf etcy.tar etc/openldap/ldap.conf

Results in:

    .
    ├── etc
    │   └── openldap
    │       └── ldap.conf
    ├── etcy.tar
    ├── etcy.tar.bz2
    └── etcy.tar.gz



## rsync ##

The smart file copier; only transfers blocks that are needed, on the fly compression.

In its simplist form, copy a file locally:

    rsync etcy.tar /mnt/sdd5/backups/

Some optional switches:

- `-v` verbose
- `-h` human friendly (`29,242,419 bytes` becomes `29.24M`)
- `--progress` show progress during transfer
- `-z` compression


Put a file onto a remote server:

    rsync etcy.tar iris.local:/home/ben/

- `-a` archive mode for presevation of symlinks, devices, attributes, permissions.
- `-u` update mode, skips files that are newer on the target
- `-b` backup
- `-e` remote shell to use (e.g. `-e ssh`)
- `--delete` remove files/dirs in the destination, that arent in the source

Complete example:

    rsync --progress -avhe ssh Fedora* schnerg@192.168.1.111:/raid1/sdd1/Software/Big/Linux/Fedora

Only get diffs, do multiple times for dodgy downloads:

    rsync -P rsync://rsync.server.com/path/to/file file

Restrict flow rate:

    rsync --bwlimit=1m fromfile tofile

Mirror web site (with compression and encryption):

    rsync -az -e ssh --delete ~/public_html/ remote.com:'~/public_html'

Synchronise current dir with remote dir:

    rsync -auz -e ssh remote:/dir/ . && rsync -auz -e ssh . remote:/dir/

## awk ##


Given a longform (`-l`) list of files and directories, filter only those starting with "pki" and ending with ".jar", outputting only the shortname.

    $ ls -l | awk 'match($10, /^pki.*\.jar$/) { print $10 }'
    pki_jcsi_2.1.2.jar
    pki_jcsi_base_2.1.2.jar
    pki_jcsi_provider_2.1.2.jar
    pki_jcsi_smime_2.1.6.jar
