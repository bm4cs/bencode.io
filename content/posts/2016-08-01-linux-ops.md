Here I aim to cover a set of common administration tasks. Things like, the hostname, system logs, what users are currently logged in, physical devices that are connected, logical volumes, file system and inode allocation, attached network interfaces and their addressing, processes and daemons currently running, kernel verison, local users and groups, installed packages, remote mounts, network shares, system uptime, bread and butter OS stats (CPU, IO, network, memory).

# Booting

    shutdown -r +5 System going down for a reboot  #wall broadcast msg
    shutdown -c  #cancel reboot
    shutdown -r 00:00  #schedule for midnight
    shutdown -h +5  #halt system in 5 mins
    shutdown -h now

Alternatively, just use systemd:

    systemctl halt
    systemctl shutdown
    systemctl poweroff:29

Runlevels (legacy):

    init 0  #shutdown
    init 6  #reboot

## Targets

A systemd target is simply a collection of units. Several types of units are possible `systemctl -t help`:

-   service
-   socket
-   busname
-   target
-   device
-   mount
-   automount
-   swap
-   timer
-   path
-   slice
-   scope

Unit configuration files live in `/usr/lib/systemd/system` e.g `/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service`, and define the service unit; pre and post execution commands, core runtime command, dependencies on other targets and/or units, targets that include this unit (e.g. `multi-user.target`) and so on. Most common targets:

-   `multi-user.target` - a multi user, text based computing environment
-   `graphical.target` -
-   `emergency.target` - root shell, read-only file system
-   `rescue.target` - a bare bones troubleshooting environment

The `isolate` command allows switching between targets (not all targets support "isolation"):

    systemctl isolate multi-user.target

The default target can be altered with `set-default` (symlink housekeeping):

    systemctl set-default graphical.target

The target used at boot time can be specified by altering the GRUB bootloader. Interupt the boot sequence, and use `e` to modify the GRUB script, find the kernel init string (starting with `linux16`) and add, for example, `systemd.unit=rescue.target` to the end. `C X` to continue boot.

## Interrupting Boot

By appending `rd.break` to the kernel init string in the GRUB boot loader (press `esc` to present the boot menu, select the target kernel, and then `e` to modify it), will inject us into the `initramfs` emergency mode shell; a barebones mini environment. `C X` to continue boot. `/sysroot` contains the eventual root mount point, that `initramfs` has prepared. Since we have interupted the init process, `/sysroot` has been "re-rooted" yet.

    mount -oremount, rw /sysroot   #get r/w perms
    chroot /sysroot   #chroot jail
    passwd root   #yup
    touch /.autorelabel   #selinux relabelling during next boot
    exit   #exit chroot jail
    exit   #exit initramfs shell

SELinux contexts will be lost. Some options include creating `.autorelabel` in root (i.e. `touch /.autorelabel`). SELinux will relabel everything.

# Process Management

## Listing

    ps aux | gnome  #manually grep ps output
    pgrep gnome  #grep for processes
    pgrep gnome -l  #show process names
    pgrep -u ben -l vi  #processes by user
    pgrep -v -u root  #v flag inverts, so all processes not owned by root

## Killing

    pkill httpd   #kill 15 all processes that grep to httpd
    kill -l   #list signal table
    pkill -SIGTERM httpd   #explicit signal

Important signals:

-   1 SIGHUP hang up, similar to closing a terminal window
-   2 SIGINT interupt, similar to `^C`
-   3 SIGQUIT, request process to quit
-   9 SIGKILL, brutally murder the process immediately
-   15 SIGTERM, gracefully terminate
-   18 SIGCONT, continue a stopped process
-   19 SIGSTOP, suspend process
-   20 SIGTSTP, optional suspend

Kill by TTY (terminal):

    $ w
    03:03:21 up 41 min,  4 users,  load average: 0.05, 0.04, 0.05
    USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
    ben      :0       :0               02:26   ?xdm?  36.10s  0.11s gdm-session-worker [pam/gdm-password]
    ben      pts/0    :0               02:26    1.00s  0.09s  2.15s /usr/libexec/gnome-terminal-server
    john     pts/2    localhost        03:02    9.00s  0.05s  0.03s vim test
    $ pkill -t pts/2
    $ pkill -u john sshd

## Jobs and Suspending

-   Work can be put to the background by adding an ampersand `&` to the end
-   Job ids should always be prefixed with a percent `%`, to make it clear a job is being referred to.

    \$ (while true; do echo -n "my program" >> ~/output.txt; sleep 1; done) &
    [1] 5398

    \$ jobs
    [1]+ Running ( while true; do echo -n "my program" >> ~/output.txt; sleep 1; done ) &

    $ kill -SIGSTOP %1
    $ jobs
    [1]+ Stopped ( while true; do echo -n "my program" >> ~/output.txt; sleep 1; done ) &

    $ kill -SIGCONT %1
    $ jobs
    [1]+ Running ( while true; do echo -n "my program" >> ~/output.txt; sleep 1; done ) &

    $ kill 15 %1
    $ jobs
    [1]+ Terminated ( while true; do echo -n "my program" >> ~/output.txt; sleep 1; done )

# Priority and Nice

Nice levels range from **-20** to **19**, **-20** representing the most favourable, and **19** the least favourable.

    $ ps aux   #BSD style, processes for all users, is user oriented format, a = BSD tsyle, x = all processes, u = user oriented format
    $ ps axo pid,comm,nice   #the PID, command and nice level
    $ ps -u root   #POSIX style all procs owned by root

Nice experiment:

    $ dd if=/dev/zero of=~/tmp/bigfile bs=1M count=1024
    $ time nice -n 19 tar -cvf bigfile.tar bigfile
    bigfile

    real  0m3.022s
    user  0m0.018s
    sys 0m1.185s

    # time nice -n -20 tar -cvf bigfile.tar bigfile
    bigfile

    real  0m2.909s
    user  0m0.018s
    sys 0m1.295s

Nice experiment two:

Start Apache with systemd:

    # systemctl start httpd
    # ps axo comm,pid,nice | grep httpd
    httpd            3874   0
    httpd            3940   0
    httpd            3941   0
    httpd            3942   0
    httpd            3943   0
    httpd            3944   0

Kill processes and restart them with nice:

    # systemctl stop httpd
    # nice -n 10 httpd
    # ps axo comm,pid,nice | grep httpd
    httpd            4344  10
    httpd            4345  10
    httpd            4346  10
    httpd            4347  10
    httpd            4348  10
    httpd            4349  10

Renice:

    # renice -n 3 $(pgrep httpd)
    4344 (process ID) old priority 10, new priority 3
    4345 (process ID) old priority 10, new priority 3
    4346 (process ID) old priority 10, new priority 3
    4347 (process ID) old priority 10, new priority 3
    4348 (process ID) old priority 10, new priority 3
    4349 (process ID) old priority 10, new priority 3

    # ps axo comm,pid,nice | grep httpd
    httpd            4344   3
    httpd            4345   3
    httpd            4346   3
    httpd            4347   3
    httpd            4348   3
    httpd            4349   3

# Load Averages and Activity

The `w` program, not only shows users that are currently logged into the system, but CPU load averages across 1, 5 and 15 minute time spans.

    $ w
    21:46:11 up  1:56,  1 user,  load average: 0.43, 0.53, 0.75
    USER     TTY        LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
    ben      tty2      19:49    1:56m 51:16   1.02s /opt/google/chrome/chrome

A personal favourite when it comes to process monitoring, is `top`, a curses based CLI that dynamically refreshes based on activity taking place. Useful shortcuts:

-   `m` toggle memory display modes in the HUD
-   `t` toggle tasks display modes in the HUD
-   `l` toggle uptime (first line) display in the HUD
-   `V` forest view (parent/child)
-   `H` thread view (as opposed to process view)
-   `B` bold key fields
-   `k` kill
-   `r` renice
-   `z` toggle color/mono display
-   `L` locate/search

Launch options:

-   `top -n 2` start, refresh twice, then terminate.
-   `top -d 2` start, setting the refresh polling interval to 2 seconds

# System Logging

Traditionally was powered by the `rsyslogd` daemon (with logs typically stored in `/var/log`), however with RHEL 7, systemd's log subsystem `journald` has been included.

`journald` by default temporarily stores its state in `/run/log/journal`, which is not peristent across system reboots. To change this default behaviour, `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` and set `Storage=persistent`. Then a reload on the `systemd` daemon. Logs will now be stored in `/var/log/journal`.

`logrotate` is

## Users

### Files that relate to local security

#### /etc/passwd

The local `/etc/passwd` ("pass wood") user database, defines all local accounts by name, an `x` for the password (which lives over in `/etc/shadow`), uid and gid, friendly description, home directly and the default shell (e.g. `/sbin/nologin` for service accounts, interactive shells such as `/bin/bash` for humans).

    $ tail -n 2 /etc/passwd
    ben:x:1000:1000:Ben Simmonds:/home/ben:/bin/bash
    tomcat:x:91:91:Apache Tomcat:/usr/share/tomcat:/bin/nologin

#### /etc/shadow

The password hashes `/etc/shadow`:

    $ sudo tail -n 2 /etc/shadow
    ben:$6$dGHFbUzk$6wMNejH9ue/n6riVfyDm8KgLCZQ5FWpzujU0yu6FICg09ihRvRlFrwONcTIuJfuA4ZdbjX4d3litJ9PcjDTYg.:16871:0:99999:7:::
    tomcat:!!:16782::::::

#### /etc/group

Defines all user to group mappings.

    $ tail -n 4 /etc/group
    ben:x:1000:ben
    lirc:x:977:
    tomcat:x:91:
    postgres:x:26:root,ben

#### /etc/skel

The skeleton directory `/etc/skel` is useful for define the default "blue print" of files and/or directories, which will be automatically cloned into new users home directories.

### Live user information

#### What user am I logged on as, and what is the assigned group id?

    $ whoami
    ben

    $ id
    uid=1000(ben) gid=1000(ben) groups=1000(ben),10(wheel),26(postgres),100(users),974(pkg-build) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

#### What users are on this host?

    $ w
     20:39:41 up 48 days,  5:34,  3 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.11, 0.22
    USER     TTY        LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
    ben      tty2      14Aug16 48days  2:17m 23.63s /opt/google/chrome/chrome
    ben      tty3      20:37    1:47   0.03s  0.03s -bash
    george   pts/12    20:39    5.00s  0.01s  0.01s -bash

Alternatively `who` gives us a more succinct output:

    $ who
    ben      tty2         2016-08-14 15:08 (:0)
    ben      tty3         2016-10-01 20:37
    george   pts/12       2016-10-01 20:39 (127.0.0.1)

### Local user management

#### New account

    useradd -m -d /home/schnerg -u 1501 -g 66 -s /bin/bash

#### Set a password (`/etc/shadow`)

    passwd schnerg

#### Lock an account

    usermod -L schnerg

Interestingly the lock, will prefix the hash in `/etc/shadow` with a bang `!`:

    schnerg:!$6$dGHFbUzk$6wMNejH9ue/n6riVfyDm8KgLCZQ5FWpzujU0yu6FICg09ihRvRlFrwONcTIuJfuA4ZdbjX4d3litJ9PcjDTYg.:16871:0:99999:7:::

#### Unlock the account

    usermod -U schnerg

#### Remove the user

    userdel schnerg

Useful options are `--remove-all-files` and `--backup`.

#### Bulk user creation

User accounts can be created in bulk using the `newusers` program, which takes in an input of `passwd` formatted (e.g. colon separated) lines.

#### Transfer all ownership for userX to userY

Transfer file ownership to another user:

    find / -uid 1003 -exec chown -v 1010:1010 {} \;

## Processes

Process ID (or pid) 1 is always the init system (e.g. sysv, upstart, systemd). The mother process the kernel hands over to initialise userspace.

The niceness of a process, indicates how "nice" a process is to other processes. The higher, the nicer (i.e. low priority). The lower, the more anti-social (think loney child) to fellow processes (i.e. high priority).

To communicate with processes, Linux supports both POSIX standard [signals](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html) and real-time signals.

> A signal is an asynchronous notification sent to a process to notify it of an event.

Signals are supported by system calls; `kill(2)` (signals target process/es), `killpg(2)` (signals all members of a process group) and `tgkill(2)` (signals a thread within a process).

For a listing of signals `kill -l` or `man 7 signal`:

**Kill parent spotify process (PID 12561)**

sending it the aggressive (murder the siht out of) `SIGKILL` (9) signal, as opposed to the default `SIGTERM` (15) signal. For a cheatsheet of available signals `kill -l`.

Kill (brutally murder) the parent spotify process (and hence it children) by sending it SIGKILL (9):

    $ kill -s 9 12561

Kill a process by name with `killall`:

    $ sudo killall cupsd

Kill processes based on name or other attributes with `pkill`, for example, kill all processes started by user _ben_:

    $ sudo pkill -u ben

You may want to verify the processes identified by the pkill filter you define, before pulling the trigger, thats where `pgrep` comes in:

    $ pgrep -u ben
    631
    1207
    1568
    1576
    1586
    1590
    1592
    1610
    ...

## Network

What network activity is taking place?

`netstat` is a swiss army knife networking. Some useful switches:

-   `-t` TCP
-   `-u` UDP
-   `-p` show the process attached to ports
-   `-l` listening ports
-   `-n` show them numerically (i.e. 80 not http)

Using all the above (unless run as superuser, PID/program information is masked for processes not owned):

    $ sudo netstat -tupln
    Active Internet connections (only servers)

## File System

Everything in UNIX is a file. Whether it be a regular file, directory, block special file, character special file, a library, a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or UNIX domain socket) to name a few.

The `lsof` utility reports on file system activity being managed by the kernel. Kudos to [tutorialLinux](https://tutorialinux.com/) for these `lsof` tips, and the numerous others.

Which processes have this file open?

    lsof /usr/lib64/libpthread-2.23.so

Which files does process X have open?

    lsof -p 1
    lsof -p $(pgrep systemd | head -n 1)

Where is the binary for this process?

    lsof -p 24855 | grep bin

Which shared libraries is this program using?

    lsof -p 24855 | grep .so

Where is this process logging to?

    lsof -p 24855 | grep log

Which processes are using a particular library (e.g. a lib with vunerabilities)?

    lsof grep libfoo.so

Which files does user XYZ have open?

    lsof -u schnerg
    lsof -u schnerg -i #network only

Which process is listening on port 5432 (or using protocol y)?

    lsof -i :5432
    lsof -i tcp
