This program is a 3-way split. A split provides balance across your workouts, and focus to major muscle groups in each workout. This is my foundation whenever I walk into a gym. Its the result of years of reading, advice from personal trainers, and tips from fellow gym buddies. I often blend it with new or different exercises to mix things up.
