Zero to One is about the value of true innovation made accessible to the masses through startups. It outlines several tenets that keen-minded business people should hold dear, including why technology trumps globalization, why we should be supporting monopolies instead of "healthy competition," why successful innovators have the worldview of a "definite optimist," and why no one should be afraid of losing their job to a robot. Zero to One also delivers unique business insights, such as the four most important things to pay attention to about your product (hint: they're not quantitative) and the seven questions every business must answer for itself.

## Key insights

1. Creating truly innovative technology requires progressing from "zero to one" rather than from "one to n". This means creating something entirely new rather than incrementally adding to what already exists.
1. One way to move from "one to n" is globalization, or enabling new markets to access something that has already been created. But, because resources are not infinite, globalization needs to be accompanied by new technologies to make the consumption of goods more efficient and sustainable, otherwise doom awaits.
1. The world needs startups as an engine to both envision and create the future. Though there has been new technology lately, there are still many aspects of everyday life that are begging for improvement, given the right vision and strategy.
1. The dot-com crash of the 1990s taught entrepreneurs lessons about how to build a business that, when followed today, hinder the development of real technological innovations and sustainable growth. These "rules" should be ignored.
1. Monopolies generate good for the world. If a business has achieved a monopoly, it indicates that the business has truly gone from "zero to one," and created something for society that did not exist before or improved upon an existing technology to such a degree that it has made the old technology obsolete.
1. To create this sort of change it is helpful to be a "definite optimist" – someone who believes that "the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better". This kind of worldview enables the vision, gumption, and persistence to go from zero to one.
1. Monopolies also generate good for the world because of the privilege that major profits allot. "Since [Google] doesn't have to worry about competing with anyone, it has wider latitude to care about its workers, its products, and its impact on the wider world".
1. Monopolies are more ubiquitous than we're led to believe and shape their stories to avoid scrutiny and regulation. For example, if Google is seen primarily as a search engine company, they own 68% of that market. In contrast, if they're described as playing in the global advertising market, they only own 3.4%.
1. Monopolies are only bad when a business lingers in that position unchallenged for too long. Ideally, new monopolies take over, "adding entirely new categories of abundance to the world". (Think of how Apple's "mobile computing" replaced Microsoft's hold on the PC market, who itself supplanted IBM's "hardware monopoly" of the 1960s and 1970s)
1. The key to creating a monopoly is to resist copying others' business models and instead to think for yourself. Prioritise four aspects of your business over a hyper-focus on growth: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
1. Rather than initially painting a grandiose vision of global market dominance, the best way to build a monopoly is to start small. Capture a small, specific market with the tentacles to easily branch to related markets over time.
1. Beware short term thinking. Those who obsess over measurement mania (e.g. active users, revenue targets) typically overlook deeper, harder to measure problems that threaten the durability of the business. For example the Zynga story.
1. Instead think long term. Will this business still be around a decade from now? Numbers alone wont help, instead critical thinking about the qualitative traits of the business is needed.
1. Know that venture capital firms typically make their money by finding the one single startup that will outperform all their other investments. The bar really is that high for your pitch.
1. The one single startup that will outperform all the others in a VC's firm's portfolio has solved a previously unaddressed problem or need in the world. In other words, they have unearthed and solved a "secret". The good news is that, despite common knowledge, there are many secrets left to find and solve.
1. The foundation you set for your startup is disproportionally important to the success of your company. The most crucial aspects to get right are related to personnel – selecting your co-founder and board.
1. Offering equity as a form of compensation can be a good way to weed out those who lack the long-term commitment to and passion for the vision of your venture.
1. The CEO of a startup should either receive the lowest salary at the company (and set an example of frugality) or the highest salary at the company (setting a maximum compensation), though if high it should be modest. If not, he or she risks getting too comfortable.
1. While the fundamental innovation your business offers is crucial, sales and distribution tactics are necessary too. Sales acumen is a key distinguisher between success and failure. "Whatever the career, sales ability distinguishes superstars from also-rans".
1. Humans have nothing to fear from technology's increasing presence in the marketplace. Instead, technology will create more opportunities for humans to do what they are uniquely good at, while the machine fills in the gaps by doing what is difficult for humans.
1. Because it requires a distinctive vision to go from zero to one, successful founders are often eccentric individuals not afraid to pursue a seemingly eccentric vision. This explains both why founders are so successful and also why they can become scapegoats for corporate dysfunction.
1. You don't have to be the founder of a brilliant company to benefit from this knowledge. As an employee, search for these qualities in the companies and leaders you work for to ensure you have the right support to develop and to keep exploring new ideas.

## Challenge of The Future

Thiel when interviewing likes to ask:

> What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

Progress can take one of two forms:

- Horizontal progress: 1 to N (replicating things that have been done before)
- Vertical progress: 0 to 1 (doing something no one has done before)

If you were to 2D plot the path of potential progress, Y would be doing new things which we call ‘technology’, X would be doing things that already work in one place and doing them elsewhere which we call ‘globalization’.

In a world of scarce resources, globalization of the status quo is unsustainable without technological advancement.

Our challenge: Imagine and create technologies to make the 21st century more peaceful and prosperous than the 20th.

## Lessons From The Dotcom Crash

After the crash people began to treat the future as indefinite and globalization replaced technology as the path forward.

People switched back from “clicks” to “bricks” (real estate) and “BRICs” (globalization) which just led to the creation of another bubble in 2008.

The backlash from the .com bubble tattooed in 4 (incorrect) lessons to the tech world:

1. Make incremental advances over what already exists
1. Stay lean and flexible (unplanned)
1. Improve on the competition (marginality)
1. Focus on product, not sales (marketing = waste)

In truth, the opposite principles are probably more correct:

1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality
1. A bad plan is better than no plan
1. Competitive markets destroy profits
1. Sales matters just as much as product

## Happy Companies Are Different

> “What valuable company is no one building?”

Value creation is not enough, you must also capture some of that value. Airlines vs Google for example, the airlines create huge value to society, but they struggle to capture it, unlike Google. In other words competitive markets destroy profits.

> “If you want to create and capture value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.”

If you have a spectrum of Perfect Competition (left) to Monopoly (right), most people imagine that firms are relatively similarly placed. When in reality, most businesses are much closer to one extreme that we (or they) would like to admit.

- Monopoly: “We’re common and therefore weak!”
- Competitive: “We’re special and therefore strong!”

Startups are tempted to understate competition and define their market so narrowly so as to dominate that market by default.

## The Ideology of Competition

Competition is a social obsession that we are trained to respond to effectively since birth through the educational system (grades, standardized tests, class rank, etc).

Pursuing _winning the competition_ usually distracts us from potentially more valuable uses of time.

### War and Peace

The concept that business ultimately requires competition (war) is flawed. Competition is a huge drain on resources and encourages a focus on old opportunities and what has worked in the past rather than looking for and pursuing new opportunities.

Funny story about how Informix put up a billboard near Oracle's Redwood Shores HQ that read "CAUTION: DINOSAUR CROSSING AHEAD" and another on Highway 101 "YOU'VE JUST PASSED REDWOOD SHORES, SO DID WE".

There is a big pull towards getting caught in a crowd competing for obvious prizes.

> “Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist” (dotcom bubble online pet stores)

In the few cases where conflict is unavoidable, its best to strike hard and end it quickly.

> “Recognize competition as a destructive force rather than a sign of value”

## Last Mover Advantage

A great company is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future, not in the short term.

- Low growth businesses lead to short term cash flows
- High growth businesses lead to long term cash flows

Growth alone isn’t enough, a company must grow and endure. For example Zynga and Groupon's short-term growth distracted executives and investors from long-term challenges. Early Farmville wins (their psychometric engine) faded out facing the same problem as every Hollywood studio; how to create an constant entertainment stream for a fickle audience.

> “Will this business still be around a decade from now?”

### Characteristics of Monopoly

All monopolies are unique but the all tend to have:

1. Proprietary technology
1. Network effects
1. Economies of scale
1. Branding

#### Proprietary Technology

The biggest advantage a company can have, is that it makes it hard to replicate (Google).

Rule of thumb: New technology must be more than 10x better than the alternatives or it will not be recognized as anything other than a marginal improvement, especially in a crowded market.

The easiest way to find a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new.

For example:

- PayPal for eBay purchases
- Amazon for book selection
- Apple for the iPhone or iPad

#### Network Effects

When a product becomes more useful with scale.

You will never get big enough to achieve network effects unless your product is valuable enough to your first users while the network is small.

Network effect businesses _must_ start with a small market and grow.

#### Economies of Scale

When a company gets more efficient as it grows.

Software businesses do this easily while service (or biotech) businesses have a much harder time.

#### Branding

Branding tactics can be copies (minimalism, material quality, etc.) but they lose impact without consistency and cohesion.

Branding can be a powerful effect but:

> “No company can be built on branding alone”

### Building a Monopoly

The above characteristics define a monopoly but you will never get there unless you grow in a very careful and deliberate way.

#### Start Small and Monopolize

On starting small:

> “It’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one”

Corollary: Small does not mean nonexistent. The perfect market is:

> “A small group of people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors”

Trying to compete in a big market leads to either no starting point and therefore no competition, or competition and therefore a race to zero margins.

#### Scaling Up

Dominate a small market and then expand gradually into adjacent markets.

Amazon: Books > CDs > Videos > Software > Everything

Ebay: Beanie Babies > Other hobby items > Everything unique

Sequencing markets correctly is an underrated skill.

#### Don’t Disrupt

I loved this clarification, a term that is abused and overused especially in tech.

_Disruption_ as a concept was coined to describe threats to established companies and as such, it’s inherently competitive.

If your company is defined by its opposition to older firms than it can’t be completely new and therefore is probably never going to be a monopoly.

_Disruption_ also attracts attention and implies that you’re destroying an incumbent; in this situation incumbents will usually fight back. Napster for example got cremated by the music industry.

As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don't disrupt, avoid competition as much as possible.

### The Last Will Be First

Being the first mover is nice but only if no one else comes along and unseats you — it’s a tactic, not a goal.

It’s far better to be the last mover in the market, aka the one who captures monopoly profits.

Do this by starting small, dominating your market, and scaling.

## You Are Not a Lottery Ticket - Be Purposeful, Be Definite

Is success a matter of luck or is it something that can be trained? Designed?

You have two choices, either you can view the future as definite and try to shape and change it or treat it as indefinite and assume you cant impact it at all.

Indefinite thinking is the source of a lot of the world’s disfunction and jack of all trades:

> “Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it ‘well roundedness’, a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it”

> “Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive — to be a monopoly of one”

```
+-----------------------------------------------+
|  Definite Optimism    |  Indefinite Optimism  |
|  US, 1950s — 1960s    |  US, 1982 — Present   |
+-----------------------------------------------+
|  Definite Pessimism   |  Indefinite Pessimism |
|  China, Present       |  Europe, Present      |
+-----------------------------------------------+
```

### Indefinite Pessimism

> “[The indefinite pessimist] looks out on a bleak future, but he has no idea what to do about it.”

“...react to events as they happen and hope that things don’t get worse.”

### Definite Pessimism

> “[The definite pessimist] believes the future can be known, but since it will be bleak, he must prepare for it.”

Such as Chinese resource hoarding in offshore accounts.

### Definite Optimism

> “[The definite optimist believes] the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better.”

Characterized by the primacy of professions with tangible output: Doctors, Scientists, Engineers, Businessmen

Outputs of this approach include the Suez and Panama Canals, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Manhattan Project, and the Apollo Missions.

People in this mode welcome big plans and ideas and ask if they will work.

### Indefinite Optimism

Between the 1982 bull market and the present is when finance eclipsed engineering as the dominant way to approach the future.

> “[The indefinite optimist knows] the future will be better but he doesn’t know how exactly, so he won’t make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely.”

Characterized by the primacy of professions of middlemen: bankers, lawyers, private equity, consultants.

Strange impact of Baby Boomers; things just got better all the time as they grew up which leads to thinking improvement always happens without any intentional effort.

They passed these values down to their kids and promoted indefinite careers.

> “A whole generation learned from childhood to overrate the power of chance and underrate the importance of planning.”

### The Return of Design

> “In startups, intelligent design works best”

Apple is a clear example of a company where intentional design was prioritised; Jobs trashing product lines on his return.

When big businesses acquire startups they almost always offer too much or too little. If the startup has no more definite future plans they pay too much. If the startup has definite plans for the future they pay too little.

### You Are Not a Lottery Ticket

Indefinite thinking needs to be replaced in philosophy, politics, etc. but those environments are highly resistant to change.

A startup is a vehicle for change that you can have definite mastery over.

A successful startup is the best way to inject definite thinking into these domains.
