A glossary of the key terms, acronyms, and ratios commonly considered business basics.

## Finance and Metrics

- **Accrual Accounting**: Records revenue when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of cash movement. Gives a truer picture than cash accounting. _(Basic accounting)_
- **EBITDA**: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. A “cleaner” view of profitability before financial structuring. _(Basic accounting)_
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: Total cost to acquire a new paying customer (ads + sales + marketing overhead ÷ new customers) [100M Leads p.208].
- **Industry CAC Benchmarks**: Varies heavily. Rule of thumb: aim for CAC ≤ 1/3 of LTGP [100M Leads p.208].
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: The total revenue expected from a customer over their relationship with you [100M Money Models p.226].
- **LTGP (Lifetime Gross Profit)**: LTV × Gross Margin %. More accurate than LTV since it accounts for cost of goods sold [100M Money Models p.228].
- **LTGP:CAC Ratio**: Healthy is ~3:1 (spend $1 to acquire, get $3+ in gross profit). If <1:1, you’re losing money; if 10:1, you’re under-investing [100M Leads p.208].
- **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Cash left after operating expenses + capital expenditures. Critical because cash pays bills, not “profits” [100M Money Models p.233].
- **Gross Margin**: (Revenue – Cost of Goods Sold) ÷ Revenue. High gross margin = scalable business.
- **Net Margin**: Net profit ÷ Revenue. Bottom-line profitability after all costs.
- **Gross vs Net**: Gross = before costs (top-line). Net = after costs (bottom-line).

## Sales

- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Revenue ÷ total customers. Useful in SaaS.
- **BAMFAM (Book A Meeting From A Meeting)**: Sales discipline: never leave a conversation without scheduling the next step [100M Closing Playbook §Closes].
- **Churn**: % of customers who cancel in a given time period. Inverse of retention [100M Retention Playbook §Churn Math].

## Business Models

- **B2C**: Business to Consumer: Selling directly to end users. Usually higher volume, lower ticket.
- **B2B**: Business to Business: Selling to other companies. Often longer sales cycles, higher ticket.
- **B2B2C**: Business sells to another business that serves end consumers (e.g., Shopify → merchants → buyers).
- **Marketplace**: Connects buyers and sellers, takes a cut (Airbnb, Uber).
- **Recurring/Subscription**: Predictable monthly revenue. Gold standard for valuations.
- **Transactional/One-off**: One-time purchases, low predictability.

## Value Equation

- **Value Equation** = _(Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) ÷ (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)_ [100M Offers p.47].
- **Grand Slam Offer**: Offer so good people feel stupid saying no [100M Offers p.22].
- **Risk Reversal**: Guarantees that shift risk from buyer to seller [Playbook – Guarantees §Hard Guarantees].
- **Scarcity/Urgency**: Limiting supply or time to push action [100M Offers p.113].
- **Cost to Value**: The perceived value must significantly exceed the price paid; customers buy when the benefit outweighs the cost.

## Healthy Business Ratios

- **LTGP:CAC = 3:1**: minimum healthy [100M Leads p.208].
- **Churn <5% monthly**: strong retention [100M Retention Playbook §Churn Math].
- **Payback Period ≤ 12 months**: CAC recovered within a year [100M Lifetime Value Playbook §Payback].
- **EBITDA Margin 15–30%**: common range for service & SaaS businesses.
