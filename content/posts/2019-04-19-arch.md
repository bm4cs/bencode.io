After witnessing insane minimalism paired with a tiler (tiling window manager), knew it was my time to take the pilgrimage to Arch Linux. Some characteristics that make Arch unique:

* [The Arch Way](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_terminology#The_Arch_Way) embody the principles behind Arch Linux; simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality and versatility.
* Forces one to build the system up by hand.
* This encourages you to question the role of each component of the system, and available options to satisfy that component (e.g. the terminal emulator).
* The result is a highly tailored and minimal system that meets precisely your needs.
* Practical and pragmatic documentation. The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) is the gold standard when it comes to documentation.
* The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a treasure chest of pre-packaged useful recent software. Somehow every program I've ever needed has been available on AUR.
* Rolling upgrades.

Arch was born in 2001, when Canadian programmer Judd Vinet, inspired by the elegance of systems such as Slackware and the BSD's, set out to build his own distro based on a similar ethos. The first formal release, 0.1, dropped on March 11, 2002.



# Pre Install

## Boot disk

To bootstrap the install process, a boot key is the way to go. Obtain the latest `iso` image, and block write it to a USB drive using `dd`. `dd` (aka disk destroyer to some) trusts you know what you're doing and can destroy data very easily if not used correctly.

Use `lsblk` to determine the mapped device name (e.g. `/dev/sdb`). When ready, pull the trigger and flash the drive with arch:

    dd if=Downloads/archlinux-2019.03.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdb status="progress"

Boot the target system on the new boot drive. If all goes well, you will end up on a bash shell, in the temporary boot preparation system provided by Arch.



## Post boot

Get network connectivity:

    wifi-menu
    ip a

Enable NTP:

    timedatectl set-ntp true




## Partitioning

UEFI (supports newer 64-bit based GPT) or BIOS (based on traditional MBR). If the below sys node doesn't exist, go BIOS:

    ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars

Determine the target block device (e.g. an SSD) for installation, using `lsblk`.

Assuming a BIOS compatible system, will go with `fdisk` (not `gdisk`) for the partitioning setup:

    fdisk /dev/sda

`fdisk` shortcuts:

- `m` help
- `p` print partition table
- `d` delete
- `n` new

In a nutshell, blow away any existing partitions (`d`), and create 4 new (`n`) primary partitions. Note when specifying the *last sector* can size with `+200M` style syntax, `+200M` is 200MiB, `+50G` is 50GiB. I cut my ~500GB drive up into the following 4 partiions:

- 200M for *boot* partition (grub etc)
- 24G for *swap* (rule of thumb is 150% of total system memory)
- 100G for *root* partition
- ~340G+ for *home* partition (leave last sector unspecified in fdisk to use all remaining space)


We are aiming for a partition layout similar to this:

    $ lsblk            
    NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda      8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk 
    ├─sda1   8:1    0   200M  0 part /boot
    ├─sda2   8:2    0    24G  0 part [SWAP]
    ├─sda3   8:3    0   100G  0 part /
    └─sda4   8:4    0 341.6G  0 part /home



## Format partitions (file systems)

Apply `ext4` (the fourth extended filesystem) to the boot, root and home partitions (i.e. all but the swap):

    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda4

Then setup the swap space:

    mkswap /dev/sda2
    swapon /dev/sda2




# Mount partitions

Now its time to mount these new partitions into the Arch bootstrapped system, so they be used.

The four partitions will be mounted into the current Arch boot preparation systems file system tree under `/mnt` so a `chroot` can occur, and then system installation. First mount the root partition, then the *boot* and *home* partitions within the *root* mount under `/mnt/boot` and `/mnt/home` respectively.

    mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
    mkdir -p /mnt/boot /mnt/home
    mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
    mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/home




# Installation


## Setup pacman mirrors

Defined in `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`. Higher mirrors in the list taken precedence over lower once, rearrange as desired:

    ##
    ## Arch Linux repository mirrorlist
    ## Filtered by mirror score from mirror status page
    ## Generated on 2019-04-01
    ##
    
    ## Australia
    Server = http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch
    ## Turkey
    Server = http://mirror.veriteknik.net.tr/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch



## Install Arch with pacstrap

The `pacstrap` script will install the `base`, and if desired other [package groups](https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/), such as [base-devel](https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/base-devel/) for common build related programs.

    pacstrap /mnt base base-devel





# Configuration

## fstab

So that the mount are automatically applied as part of the system boot process, add them to `/etc/fstab` as UUID's, which are more robust than device names which can change.

    genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

## chroot

Now to change root into the new system, from the Arch boot preparation system:

    arch-chroot /mnt


## root password

Set the password for the root account with `passwd`


## Localisation

Uncomment `en_US.UTF-8` and `UTF-8` in `/etc/locale.gen`, and generate:

    locale-gen

Create `/etc/locale.conf` with:

    LANG=en_US.UTF-8


## Time zone

Symlink in the appropriate zone definition:

    ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Canberra /etc/localtime

Run `hwclock --systohc` to generate `/etc/adjtime`



## Networking

- Create `/etc/hostname`, and define a name for the host.
- Edit `/etc/hosts` for loopback based on the defined hostname above, `127.0.1.1	myhostname.localdomain	myhostname`
- Install NetworkManager which provides persistent network configuration across reboots, `pacman -S networkmanager` and enable it `systemctl enable NetworkManager`



## Boot loader (GRUB)

Several boot loaders are [supported](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_boot_process#Boot_loader) but here are going with GRUB.

    pacman -S grub
    grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda
    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg



# Reboot

A minimal base system is installed and configured, and ready to be used.

- Escape chroot with ctrl+d or `exit`.
- Unmount everything `umount -R /mnt`, `lsblk` should confirm this.
- `reboot`
- Remove the USB drive





# Post boot

## Wifi

Unfortunately wifi settings were not persisted. Fix with network manager:

    nmcli dev wifi connect wifi-sid-goes-here password wifi-password-goes-here

Also make sure to that `wifi-menu` is functional, by installing the `dialog` package. `netctl` is useful for troubleshooting. Ensure that the network profile for the wifi is enabled using `netctl`.

See [archwiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#nmcli_examples):

* `nmcli device wifi list` sniff currently available wifi ssids in range
* `nmcli connection show` show active connection/s
* `nmcli device wifi connect Jeneffer password S3CR3T` connect to ssid
* `nmcli device wifi connect Jeneffer password S3CR3T hidden yes` connect to hidden ssid
* `nmcli connection up uuid UUID` reconnect a disconnected interface
* `nmcli device` list all interfaces and their state
* `mcli device disconnect wlp3s0` disconnect an interface
* `nmcli radio wifi off` disable wifi radio



## Add users

    useradd -m -g wheel ben
    passwd ben
    sudo vi /etc/sudoers

Uncomment (line 85) to allow members of the wheel group to sudo with (or without) password prompting:

    %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL


## GPU drivers

I've got a mix of machines with nvidia and amd accelerators. Just follow the bouncing ball on the appropriate arch wiki:

* [AMDGPU](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AMDGPU) for the open source AMD based driver
* [NVIDIA](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA) the proprietary blob

Once installed verify with some benchmarks, before installing steam. Install `glmark2` from the AUR, then bench.

## Essential applications (user space)

If you've gone down the window manager (i.e. tiler) route, there is literally nothing, its a minimalist wasteland. Here's the progs I use to support my specific computer based workflows (as a software dev and terminal fan).

## Desktop Environment (DE) vs Window Manager (WM)

In a nutshell a DE (like gnome or kde) is heavy weight includes everything bar the kitchen sink, such as music players, document editors, file managers, status bars, network managers, start menus, etc. They are incredibly bloated, but aimed at novice users that just want their computer "to work". A WM (like dwm or i3) on the other hand is incredibly lean, I mean you don't even get a status bar, but are very customisable and do just what you want and no more. Because of this WM's tend to be allot snappier. I personally prefer using a WM, and more specifically a tiling WM (aka a *tiler*) and highly recommend [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/):

> Because dwm is customized through editing its source code [C], it's pointless to make binary packages of it. This keeps its userbase small and elitist. No novices asking stupid questions.

I have started to form some of my own opinions around the use of a tiler:

* Gaps between windows are literally a waste of space. Don't do this.
* Don't bother with lots of the cosmetic ricing hacks out there, its all bloat.
* Toolbars (such as `polybar`) display redundant information at the cost of cognitive overload and wasted screen real-estate. If I want to know the time I look at my watch.


### dwm

I've have recently discovered [suckless](https://suckless.org/), and their [philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/) towards software really resonates strongly with me.

> We are the home of quality software such as dwm, dmenu, st and plenty of other tools, with a focus on simplicity, clarity and frugality. Our philosophy is about keeping things simple, minimal and usable.

`dwm` is their minimal tiling window manager.

> Because dwm is customized through editing its source code, it's pointless to make binary packages of it. This keeps its userbase small and elitist. No novices asking stupid questions.

The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom `config.h`, by editing the `config.def.h` header, and (re)compiling the source code using the provided makefile.

    pacman -Sy xorg-server xorg-xinit
    pacman -Sy xf86-video-amdgpu
    pacman -Sy dmenu git

Clone the `dwm` Git repo, and my patches:

    git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
	git clone https://github.com/bm4cs/dots.git
	cd ~/dotfiles && ./install.sh

Apply [patches](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/) for specific features wanted. The only patch I apply is [center](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/center/):

> Add an iscentered rule to automatically center clients on the current monitor.

This lets you define rules in `config.def.h` for certain programs (e.g. pulsemixer) that you'd like to launch center screen, by adding an `iscentered` rule to automatically center clients on the current monitor:

    static const Rule rules[] = {
    	/* xprop(1):
    	 *	WM_CLASS(STRING) = instance, class
    	 *	WM_NAME(STRING) = title
    	 */
    	/* class      instance       title       tags mask     iscentered     isfloating   monitor */
    	{ "Gimp",     NULL,          NULL,       0,            0,             1,           -1 },

To you can see the `WM_CLASS` and `WM_NAME` properties of the X window are used by the rule chain to figure out what rules to apply. To determine these values, use `xprop` which will give you a mouse cursor to select the window of the running program you are interested in, and will dump its property to stdout:

    $ xprop WM_CLASS
    WM_CLASS(STRING) = "st-256color", "st-256color"
    
    $ xprop WM_CLASS
    WM_CLASS(STRING) = "st-256color", "st-256color"
    
    $ xprop WM_NAME
    WM_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = "vim"


Build and install:

    make && sudo make install

To autostart `dwm`:

Edit `~/.xinitrc` with following:

    exec dwm

Then `startx`. A black screen desktop should appear. This is good.

### i3-gaps

`i3-gaps` is a fork of the excellent `i3wm` tiling window manager. As its name implies it supports placing gaps (i.e. regions of space) between the tiled windows, providing a very neat and satisfying perception of order when windows are automatically laid out.

![i3-gaps in action](/images/i3-snap.jpg "i3-gaps in action")

    pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit
    pacman -S xf86-video-amdgpu
    pacman -S i3-gaps i3status rxvt-unicode dmenu

To autostart i3:

Edit `~/.xinitrc` with following:

    exec i3

Then `startx`. A black screen desktop should appear. This is good.




## Default applications

Programs that handle arbitrary files (e.g. web browsers, irc clients, file managers) delegate to a general purpose resource handler. *XDG MIME Applications* is the ubiquitous option here, and is not only an implementation, but a full blown specification.

To check a default program to be used based on MIME type:

    xdg-mime query default text/plain

Or, if unsure of the MIME type, to check a default program based on a sample input file:

    xdg-mime query filetype 2016-01-12-jdbc-overflow.markdown

To set a default handler, the program needs a, the program needs a `.desktop` launcher. First make sure one exists:

    $ locate -i nvim.desktop
    /usr/share/applications/nvim.desktop

Then bind it as the default for a given file (MIME) type:

    xdg-mime default nvim.desktop text/plain

Test it out:

    xdg-open 2018-01-08-pki.markdown

These are stored in `~/.local/mimeapps.list`.




## Ricing

> The term ricing originates from the auto enthusiast community, and was used predominantly as a perjorative to describe people who make modifications to their (usually Japanese) cars that add visual flair, but don't improve performance. In the context of unixporn, it means customizing your desktop to make it look snazzy.

This rice was used on `i3`. While I enjoyed my brief time using this excellent tiler, I have moved to using suckless `dwm`. While these ricing hacks should apply to various window managers and tilers, I havent verified.

### Wallpaper

    pacman -S feh

Add a task runner to `~/.config/i3/config` to always set the wallpaper whenever i3 runs.

    exec_always --no-startup-id feh --bg-scale /home/ben/Pictures/Wallpapers/nature3.jpg

### Sound

    pacman -S alsa-utils

Can now run `alsamixer` to manage the sound card.

### Load Xresources at startup

Need to customise the appearance of apps like `urxvt`.

    exec_always --no-startup-id xrdb -load ~/.Xresources

If you dont have an `~/.Xresources` of your own, checkout my [dots](https://github.com/bm4cs/dots).


### Making GTK and QT apps pretty

    pacman -S lxappearance gtk-chtheme gtk-engine-murrine gtk-engines gnome-themes-extra qt5ct

Define the following environment variables to override default QT styling:

    export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=adwaita
    export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME="qt5ct"
    export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0





# Conclusion

This is a worth while endevour to take. I now have a very tailored system that works exactly how I want, without any bloat, and its FAST. Finally if interested, all my configuration from `vim` to `st` and `dwm` is in my [dots](https://github.com/bm4cs/dots) repo.

I've have recently discovered [suckless](https://suckless.org/), and their [philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/) towards software really resonates strongly with me.
