BCAA's (Branched chain amino acids) have always had a place in my gym bag for about the last 2 years.

> A branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) is an amino acid having aliphatic side-chains with a branch (a carbon atom bound to more than two other carbon atoms). Among the proteinogenic amino acids, there are three BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine and valine. 

> The BCAAs are among the nine essential amino acids for humans, accounting for 35% of the essential amino acids in muscle proteins and 40% of the preformed amino acids required by mammals

In the gym environment are often associated with better endurance, recovery times and even "the pump". One particular BCAA product on the market I found particularly effective was Poliquin's [BCAA Exellence 2.0](http://mainwholesale.poliquinstore.com/bcaa-excellence-2). *BCAA Exellence 2.0* differs from other BCAA products for a couple of reasons:

* It comes in capsule form
* It includes L Lysine
* Its expensive

The increased recovery times and endurance are nice features, however the key reason I take them is for the stronger pump I experienced during workouts, or in Poliquin speak:

> An increase in anabolism in concert with a decrease in catabolism through raising of insulin and GH (growth hormone).

> An increase in post workout testosterone levels

Never having tried BCAA's prior to using Poliquin, I found my workouts intensified significantly, and the need to take other (expensive) protein supplements went away  — I used to consume 150g of protein powder on a daily basis. Don't be fooled here though...the pump sensation may not actually be attributed to BCAA's directly, but more due to the fact that it contains L-Lysine.

> L-Lysine is a necessary building block for all protein in the body. L-Lysine plays a major role in calcium absorption; building muscle protein; recovering from surgery or sports injuries; and the body's production of hormones, enzymes, and antibodies.

My problem being based in Australia, is that shipping Poliquins already expensive *BCAA Exellence 2.0* every couple of weeks was not feasible. So I crunched some numbers...


**Poliquin BCAA Excellence 2.0**

At $52 for 500 serves. Each serve (capsule) is 0.2875 grams. Here's how that 0.2875 grams blend breaks down:

*   Leucine 0.0375g (13%)
*   Isoleucine 0.090g (31%)
*   Valine 0.090g (31%)
*   Lysine HCL 0.070g (24%)

That's 10 cents per serve.

The general rule of thumb is to consume at least 10 grams of BCAA pre and during the workout. 10 grams equals about 35 capsules, although I find I take about 50-60.

That's $3.62 per 10 grams.


**Bulk Nutrients DIY Blend**

So I thought I'd see if I could put together my own version of *BCAA Excellence 2.0*. Australian based [Bulk Nutrients](http://www.bulknutrients.com.au/) offers very competitvely priced supplements.

I can get a 1KG (2.2lbs) bag of [L-Lysine](http://www.bulknutrients.com.au/buy/l-lysine/LLYSI) for AU$29, and a 1KG (2.2lbs) bag of [BCAA's](http://www.bulknutrients.com.au/buy/branched-chain-amino-acids-bcaas-unflavoured/BCAAS) for AU$49.

Lets break down the numbers. First the BCAA's.

At $49 for 200 serves. In powder form each serve is 5 grams. Here's how the 5 grams blend breaks down (note the absence of any of the secret ingrediant Lysine):

*   Leucine 2.5g (50%)
*   Isoleucine 1.25g (25%)
*   Valine 1.25g (25%)

That's 24 cents per serve, or a dirt cheap 49 cents per 10 grams (target dosage).

Lastly we need to add the equivalent amount of L Lysine as *BCAA Excellence 2.0*. Breaking down Poliquins original numbers:

*   Leucine 0.0375g (13%)
*   Isoleucine 0.090g (31%)
*   Valine 0.090g (31%)
*   Lysine HCL 0.070g (24%)

As you can see, 24% of the product is Lysine. Thats about 2.4 grams per 10 grams (our target dosage). Bulk Nutients L-Lysine is $29 per 1KG, which works out to be about 7 cents per 2.4 grams.

So a DIY version of *BCAA Excellence 2.0* including Lysine costs $0.56 per 10 grams, versus Poliquins $3.62.

At 15% of the cost (or an 85% saving not including international shipping costs), that's just way too good for me to pass up.
