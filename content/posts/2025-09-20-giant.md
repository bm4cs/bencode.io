## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1: Dreams of Destiny

Key concepts:

- The power of decision
- Take personal responsibility for everything
- Breaking limiting patterns

The 3 master principles of enduring change:

1. **Raise your standards**: Change what I demand of myself.
2. **Change your limiting beliefs**: Develop a sense of certainty that I _can_ and _will_ meet the new standards, before I actually do.
3. **Change your strategy**: Apply the best strategies to achieve results (e.g. remodel off a role model, coaching, mentorship)

5 areas of life to master:

1. **Emotional**: Virtually everything we do is to change the way we feel.
2. **Physical**: The health, energy and power to take on each day to the fullest.
3. **Relational**: Internally, then externally; romantic, family, business, community and social.
4. **Financial**: A means of contribution, a tool. Change the cause of scarcity, and experience the values, beliefs and emotions essential to experiencing wealth.
5. **Time**: Short-term thinking = long-term pain. Limit short-term gratification, to allow ideas, creations, and potential to bear fruits.
