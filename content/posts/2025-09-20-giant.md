## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1: Dreams of Destiny

Key concepts:

- The power of decision
- Take personal responsibility for everything
- Breaking limiting patterns

The 3 master principles of enduring change:

1. **Raise your standards**: Change what I demand of myself.
2. **Change your limiting beliefs**: Develop a sense of certainty that I _can_ and _will_ meet the new standards, before I actually do.
3. **Change your strategy**: Apply the best strategies to achieve results (e.g. remodel off a role model, coaching, mentorship)

5 areas of life to master:

1. **Emotional**: Virtually everything we do is to change the way we feel.
2. **Physical**: The health, energy and power to take on each day to the fullest.
3. **Relational**: Internally, then externally; romantic, family, business, community and social.
4. **Financial**: A means of contribution, a tool. Change the cause of scarcity, and experience the values, beliefs and emotions essential to experiencing wealth.
5. **Time**: Short-term thinking = long-term pain. Limit short-term gratification, to allow ideas, creations, and potential to bear fruits.

Quotes:

> "You have to be the champion before you become the champion" - Mike Tyson

> "Most people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in ten years" - Bill Gates

### Chapter 2: Decisions: The Pathway to Power

The word "decision" comes from the Latin verb dēcīdere, which is formed from the parts **dē** meaning "off" or "away", and **caedere** meaning "to cut" or "to strike". Therefore, to make a decision is literally to "cut off" possibilities, settling on one course of action and cutting away from all others.

> "Your life changes the moment you make a new, congruent, and committed decision"

Making a real decision means committing to achieving a result...and cutting off any other possibility. It important to actively and regularly exercise decision making. Being lazy and not making decisions, is also, counterintuitively, a decision. Take control, make decisions regularly, learn and improve and make better ones.

#### Ultimate Success Formula

There's nothing you can't accomplish if:

1. Clearly decide what it is that you're absolutely committed to achieving
2. You are willing to take massive action
3. You notice what's working and what's not
4. You course correct until you achieve results, using whatever life gives along the way

#### Three Decisions That Control Your Destiny

1. My decisions about what to focus on.
2. My decisions about what things mean to you.
3. My decisions about what to do to create the results you desire.

#### Harnessing The Power Of Decisions

1. Never forget the power of making decisions. Its a tool you can use in any moment to change your entire life. Don't be a victim (e.g. when you feel overwhelmed, that there's no choice, things are happening "to" you). You have the power to change it all, if you decide to do so. Critically for a decision to be birthed, **there must be action** associated with it.
2. Understand the hardest step in achieving anything is making a true commitment.

Quotes:

> "I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor" - Henry David Thoreau

> "If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change" - Dr. Wayne Dyer

### Chapter 3: The Force That Shapes Your Life (pain and pleasure)

Key concepts:

- Pain and pleasure as motivators
- Neuro-Associative Conditioning (NAC)
- Leveraging pain and pleasure

All our underlying motivations, are driven either by the need to avoid pain, or to gain pleasure. The twin powers that drive us.

For most, the fear (pain) of loss outweighs the desire for gain (pleasure).

Many tolerate a level of pain, until the _emotional threshold_ tipping point in reached. This is the magical moment where pain becomes a great ally, driving action that produces new results. Ultimately stemming from the desire to remove pain and establish pleasure (e.g. pride, comfort, sense of accomplishment, building, energy, etc).

What you link pain and pleasure to shapes your destiny. For example, I personally link pleasure to learning. It provides me skills, skills I can share and help others with, the opportunity to contribute something of value to others. This can often "flywheel" into affiliate pleasures, such as sharing profound knowledge in a passionate way in the form of podcasts, presentations, teaching at schools and so on.

By linking massive pain to any behavior or emotional pattern, will avoid indulging in it. We can exploit the force of pain and pleasure to change virtually anything in our lives. For change to last, old behavior needs to be linked to pain and new behavior to pleasure, and conditioned in until a consistent habit is formed.

**Short-term vs Long-term**:

Humans generally make decisions about whats going to create pain or pleasure in the **short-term**. Yet in order to succeed, most things require breaking through the wall of short-term pain in order to attain **long-term** pleasure. What is important in the long-term, are values and personal standards.

- Short-term pleasure = long-term pain
- Short-term pain = long-term pleasure

Its not actual pain that drives us, but our fear that something will lead to pain. Similarly its not actual pleasure that drives us, but our belief that taking a certain action will lead to please. In other words, we are creature not driven by reality, but by our perception of reality.

Going into business for example, must overcome the fear of losing security to make that happen. Most things that are valuable in our lives require us to go against the fundamental conditioning of our nervous systems. Its crucial to manage fears by overriding this preconditioned set of responses, transforming fear into power.

In most cases, the fears we allow to control us, never becomes a reality anyway. Instead we should live in the present and respond to matters that are real, not to fear of what once was or might someday be. The key, we don't move away from _real pain_, we move away from what we believe will lead to pain.

#### Enacting Change Blueprint

1. Write down 4 actions you need to take that you've been putting off
2. Consider why you haven't already acted, and what linked forms of pain you have to each action
3. List the pleasures (short-term) you've indulged in through the negative pattern of not acting
4. List what it will cost you if you don't change (long-term, emotionally, financially, physical energy levels, relationships)
5. List the pleasures you'll receive by taking each action right now

Quotes:

> "If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your own estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment" - Marcus Aurelius

> "Nature has placed mankind under the government of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think: every effort we can make to throw off our subjection, will serve but to demonstrate and confirm it" - Jeremy Bentham

### Chapter 4: Belief Systems: The Power to Create and the Power to Destroy

Key concepts:

- How beliefs are formed
- Empowering vs limiting beliefs
- Changing belief systems

It's never the environment or the events that shape us, but the **meaning** we attach to them, that shapes who we are now and who we'll become tomorrow.

Beliefs conceptually are simple; a guiding force to tell us what will lead to pain and pleasure, and the way to acquire more pleasure and less pain. Beliefs therefore are generalisations about what we've learned could cause pain or pleasure. They guide all actions and thus the direction and quality of life.

Generalisations, a useful evolutionary born skill, endow humans with powerful pattern recognition abilities. E.g. when you encounter a door you've never seen before, you know that turning the handle and then pushing or pulling the door, will likely open it. Why do you believe this? All your life experience with doors up to this point has provided enough references to create a **sense of certainty**, giving you the confidence to follow through.

Unfortunately the skill of generalising is harmful to the human condition, particularly in the more subtle and complex areas of life which are exposed to oversimplification, and cemented by limiting beliefs. E.g. not learning as quickly in school as others, may create the limiting belief of being a "slow learner", rather than considering the reality being gifted with a different (and superior) learning strategy.

Global beliefs are the giant general beliefs we have about everything in our lives: identities, people, work, time, money, etc, and often phrased is/am/are: "Life is ...", "I am ...", "People are ...". Making one change to a global belief can have huge repercussions to most aspects of your life.

#### The Belief Tabletop Metaphor

An idea is a tabletop with no legs. Without legs, it can't stand, its nothing. Belief however, underpinned by **references** (experiences, intuition, understanding), provides those legs. The strongest legs are formed by personal experiences that have attached emotion, as a result of being painful or pleasurable. The more emotional intensity, the stronger the leg.

A belief can be defined as a feeling of certainty about a subject. A belief you are intelligent is the same as being certain you are intelligent. Knowing I am highly intelligent allows me to tap into the resources to do intelligent things. A lack of believe takes this capacity away.

The big penny drop moment to realise here, is the power of the human imagination; references do not have to be real or even accurate, in order to leverage them.

> Every great achiever has had the ability to feel certain of succeeding, prior to actually accomplishing it

In other words, having complete faith (sense of certainty) in ones beliefs, is the gateway to accomplishing anything.

#### Patterns of Beliefs

Dr Martin Seligman, classifies 3 patterns of beliefs that cause helplessness, and the destruction of a human. The difference between winners and losers.

- **Permanence**: The greats succeed in spite of problems and barriers, the difference between them and others who give up, is their belief in the permanence, or lack thereof, of their problems. One must believe that "this, too, shall pass" and that is you keep persisting, there is a way.
- **Pervasiveness**: An achiever never sees a problem as a single problem that controls their life. An optimist compartments problems, deals with them, and move forward. A pessimist allows them to permeate and rot throughout other aspects of life (kids, family, work, health etc).
- **Personal**: Losers perceive problems as a personal failing. Winners reframe problems as challenges and growth.

#### The Keys to Changing Beliefs

All personal breakthroughs begin with altering beliefs.

**Leverage pain/pleasure**: The most effective way to start, is by associating massive pain to the old belief. You must feel so deep in your gut, that not only has a belief cost you pain, but its costing you the present and future. You must also associate tremendous pleasure to the idea of adopting new, empowering belief.

**Create doubt**: Honestly questioning beliefs, removes the sense of certainty about them. Many beliefs are formed from the information from others, blindly accepted. If you question or scutinise anything enough, eventually you'll being to doubt it. E.g. the QWERTY vs DVORAK story.

Knocking out the legs of disempowering beliefs:

1. How is this belief ridiculous or absurd?
2. Was the person I learned this belief from worth modeling?
3. What will it ultimately cost me emotionally, relationally, physically or financially, or my family/loved ones if I don't let this go?

New beliefs infusion:

1. Replace limiting beliefs with empowering beliefs
2. What would I have to believe in order to succeed here?
3. Who is already succeeding in this area, and what do they believe differently than I do or whats possible?
4. Whats necessary to believe in order to succeed?

#### Convictions = Mastery

A **belief** transmutes into a **conviction** when you believe huge pain will result without this belief. I were to change this belief, I would be giving up the core of my identity.

The most effective way to attaining mastery in any area of life, is to raise a belief to the level of a conviction.

A conviction, a belief with such emotional intensity, has the power to drive you to action, push through obstacles.

For example, I know that I, Benjamin Simmonds, is highly intelligent, that I stand on mountains of intellectual capital, and can always find a way to turn things around. This conviction has help me overcome, steer and lead me and my family through some of the toughest moments in my life.

#### Conviction Creation Formula

1. **The seed**: Start with a basic belief
2. **Feed it**: Reinforce the belief by adding new and more powerful references. Reading more books, acquiring more knowledge, being around people that share similar beliefs. The more references you develop, the most emotionally fuelled the references become, fanning the flames of a more powerful and greater conviction.
3. **Trigger**: Find or create a triggering event: Ask questions that create emotional intensity, "what will it cost me if I dont?" e.g. trying to quit smoking, visit the emphysema patients on life support
4. **Take massive action**: Each action strengthens, cements and calluses your commitment, as raises the level of emotional intensity.

#### Deming and the Quality Revolution = CANI = long term beats short term

Dr W Edwards Deming, in 1950 was a renown quality control expert, responsible for setting off the quality movement in post-war Japan.

Deming taught 14 principles and a basic core belief that constant, never-ending commitment to consistently increase the quality of their business every single day. That quality is not just a matter of meeting certain standards, but rather is a living, breathing process of never ending improvement.

The belief that quality costs less, that by creating a quality product, they would get more satisfied and loyal customers, who would be willing to wait in line and pay more for their product.

#### CANI (Constant And Never-ending Improvement) Daily Ritual

In order to succeed and be successful as humans, must constantly be improving the quality of our lives, by continually growing and expanding.

In Japan, constant improvement is deeply appreciated, so much so its permeates their culture, **kaizen**. In english there is no equivalent word.

A nice daily reflection practice, at the end of each day, consider:

1. What have I learned today?
2. What did I contribute or improve?
3. What did I enjoy?
