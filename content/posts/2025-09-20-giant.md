## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1: Dreams of Destiny

Key concepts:

- The power of decision
- Take personal responsibility for everything
- Breaking limiting patterns

The 3 master principles of enduring change:

1. **Raise your standards**: Change what I demand of myself.
2. **Change your limiting beliefs**: Develop a sense of certainty that I _can_ and _will_ meet the new standards, before I actually do.
3. **Change your strategy**: Apply the best strategies to achieve results (e.g. remodel off a role model, coaching, mentorship)

5 areas of life to master:

1. **Emotional**: Virtually everything we do is to change the way we feel.
2. **Physical**: The health, energy and power to take on each day to the fullest.
3. **Relational**: Internally, then externally; romantic, family, business, community and social.
4. **Financial**: A means of contribution, a tool. Change the cause of scarcity, and experience the values, beliefs and emotions essential to experiencing wealth.
5. **Time**: Short-term thinking = long-term pain. Limit short-term gratification, to allow ideas, creations, and potential to bear fruits.

> "Most people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in ten years" - Bill Gates

### Chapter 2: Decisions: The Pathway to Power

The word "decision" comes from the Latin verb dēcīdere, which is formed from the parts **dē** meaning "off" or "away", and **caedere** meaning "to cut" or "to strike". Therefore, to make a decision is literally to "cut off" possibilities, settling on one course of action and cutting away from all others.

> "Your life changes the moment you make a new, congruent, and committed decision"

Making a real decision means committing to achieving a result...and cutting off any other possibility. It important to actively and regularly exercise decision making. Being lazy and not making decisions, is also, counterintuitively, a decision. Take control, make decisions regularly, learn and improve and make better ones.

#### Ultimate Success Formula

There's nothing you can't accomplish if:

1. Clearly decide what it is that you're absolutely committed to achieving
2. You are willing to take massive action
3. You notice what's working and what's not
4. You course correct until you achieve results, using whatever life gives along the way

#### Three Decisions That Control Your Destiny

1. My decisions about what to focus on.
2. My decisions about what things mean to you.
3. My decisions about what to do to create the results you desire.

#### Harnessing The Power Of Decisions

1. Never forget the power of making decisions. Its a tool you can use in any moment to change your entire life. Don't be a victim (e.g. when you feel overwhelmed, that there's no choice, things are happening "to" you). You have the power to change it all, if you decide to do so. Critically for a decision to be birthed, **there must be action** associated with it.
2. Understand the hardest step in achieving anything is making a true commitment.

Quotes:

> "I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor" - Henry David Thoreau

> "If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change" - Dr. Wayne Dyer

### Chapter 3: The Force That Shapes Your Life (pain and pleasure)

Key concepts:

- Pain and pleasure as motivators
- Neuro-Associative Conditioning (NAC)
- Leveraging pain and pleasure

All our underlying motivations, are driven either by the need to avoid pain, or to gain pleasure. The twin powers that drive us.

For most, the fear (pain) of loss outweighs the desire for gain (pleasure).

Many tolerate a level of pain, until the _emotional threshold_ tipping point in reached. This is the magical moment where pain becomes a great ally, driving action that produces new results. Ultimately stemming from the desire to remove pain and establish pleasure (e.g. pride, comfort, sense of accomplishment, building, energy, etc).

What you link pain and pleasure to shapes your destiny. For example, I personally link pleasure to learning. It provides me skills, skills I can share and help others with, the opportunity to contribute something of value to others. This can often "flywheel" into affiliate pleasures, such as sharing profound knowledge in a passionate way in the form of podcasts, presentations, teaching at schools and so on.

By linking massive pain to any behavior or emotional pattern, will avoid indulging in it. We can exploit the force of pain and pleasure to change virtually anything in our lives. For change to last, old behavior needs to be linked to pain and new behavior to pleasure, and conditioned in until a consistent habit is formed.

**Short-term vs Long-term**:

Humans generally make decisions about whats going to create pain or pleasure in the **short-term**. Yet in order to succeed, most things require breaking through the wall of short-term pain in order to attain **long-term** pleasure. What is important in the long-term, are values and personal standards.

- Short-term pleasure = long-term pain
- Short-term pain = long-term pleasure

Its not actual pain that drives us, but our fear that something will lead to pain. Similarly its not actual pleasure that drives us, but our belief that taking a certain action will lead to please. In other words, we are creature not driven by reality, but by our perception of reality.

Going into business for example, must overcome the fear of losing security to make that happen. Most things that are valuable in our lives require us to go against the fundamental conditioning of our nervous systems. Its crucial to manage fears by overriding this preconditioned set of responses, transforming fear into power.

In most cases, the fears we allow to control us, never becomes a reality anyway. Instead we should live in the present and respond to matters that are real, not to fear of what once was or might someday be. The key, we don't move away from _real pain_, we move away from what we believe will lead to pain.

#### Enacting Change Blueprint

1. Write down 4 actions you need to take that you've been putting off
2. Consider why you haven't already acted, and what linked forms of pain you have to each action
3. List the pleasures (short-term) you've indulged in through the negative pattern of not acting
4. List what it will cost you if you don't change (long-term, emotionally, financially, physical energy levels, relationships)
5. List the pleasures you'll receive by taking each action right now

Quotes:

> "If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your own estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment" - Marcus Aurelius

> "Nature has placed mankind under the government of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think: every effort we can make to throw off our subjection, will serve but to demonstrate and confirm it" - Jeremy Bentham
