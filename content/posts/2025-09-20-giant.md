## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1: Dreams of Destiny

Key concepts:

- The power of decision
- Take personal responsibility for everything
- Breaking limiting patterns

The 3 master principles of enduring change:

1. **Raise your standards**: Change what I demand of myself.
2. **Change your limiting beliefs**: Develop a sense of certainty that I _can_ and _will_ meet the new standards, before I actually do.
3. **Change your strategy**: Apply the best strategies to achieve results (e.g. remodel off a role model, coaching, mentorship)

5 areas of life to master:

1. **Emotional**: Virtually everything we do is to change the way we feel.
2. **Physical**: The health, energy and power to take on each day to the fullest.
3. **Relational**: Internally, then externally; romantic, family, business, community and social.
4. **Financial**: A means of contribution, a tool. Change the cause of scarcity, and experience the values, beliefs and emotions essential to experiencing wealth.
5. **Time**: Short-term thinking = long-term pain. Limit short-term gratification, to allow ideas, creations, and potential to bear fruits.

### Chapter 2: Decisions: The Pathway to Power

> "Your life changes the moment you make a new, congruent, and committed decision" - Tony Robbins

Key concepts:

- Three decisions that control destiny
- The decision-making process
- Commitment vs interest

Making a real decision means committing to achieving a result...and cutting off any other possibility. It important to actively and regularly exercise decision making. Being lazy and not making decisions, is also oddly a decision. Take control, make decisions regularly, learn and improve and make better ones.

Ultimate success formula:

1. Decide what you want
2. Take action
3. Notice whats working or not
4. Course correct until you achieve results

3 decisions that control your destiny:

1. My decisions about what to focus on.
2. My decisions about what things mean to you.
3. My decisions about what to do to create the results you desire.

Quotes:

> "I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor" - Henry David Thoreau

### Chapter 3: The Force That Shapes Your Life (pain and pleasure)
