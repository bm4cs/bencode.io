> NiFi was built to automate the flow of data between systems

The problem domain of dataflow is an old one, and many well established patterns [exist](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/).

NiFi core design is based on the flow based programming (FBP), treats data flows as a first class citizens, literally called a `FlowFile`.

Having had some exposure to some enterprise middleware products of the 00's, NiFi takes a fresh approach to the problem space:

- Guaranteed delivery (write ahead log), back pressure, prioritised queues, QoS (latency vs throughput)
-
