## Overview

### Layer 2 (Link)

At the physical link layer how do devices communicate (i.e, interconnect and exchange data)?

- Each device has a NIC that ships with a unique MAC (6-byte) address such as `30-65-EC-6F-C4-58`
- The first 3-bytes are used to flag the vendor
- Packets traditionally were broadcasted out to a devices
- Network switches dynamically learn and build up a mapping table of MAC to Ports

Complexity slowly increases.

- Many devices. Switches connected to switches.
- A interesting problem arose where the infinite broadcasting of unroutable packets could bring a network to its knees; _bridge loops_ and _broadcast radiation_.
- Protocols such as [Spanning Tree Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol) invented by a smart lady [Radia Perlman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radia_Perlman), overcame this by computing a least-cost tree across nodes and automatically unblocking or blocking the necessary switch ports to achieve it.
- At the electrical level, many corruption issues were experienced in practice. CRC checksums were introduced.
- Duplicate MAC addresses are a challenging issue; the addresses

As logical addressing schemes such as IP build on-top of layer 2, a scheme was needed for figuring out layer 2 MAC addresses from given only logical IP addresses.

- ARP was born "Address Resolution Protocol"
- Makes use of a special layer 2 packet known as a _broadcast packet_ (destination MAC is `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`)
- The broadcast packet floods the network, and is delivered to all

Some security standards as this layer have emerged, most notably [MACsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1AE).

### Layer 3 (Network)

As the needs and complexity of a layer 2 network grows, it becomes necessary to interlink network switches, which in-turn can connective many dozens of devices.

- A interest problem arose.
- As layer 2 operates by flooding and learning (coined a _broadcast storm_) to determine the physical MAC addresses of peers, results in much chatter.
- This is a known as a _Broadcast Domain_ used by layer 2 to support its _flood and learn_ model.
- This doesn't scale; the bigger layer 2 networks become the more flood and learn chatter that occurs.
- To scale, layer 3 (IP) networks were devised.
- By carving layer 2 broadcasting domains into _subnets_, it is now possible, using routers, to interlink these layer 2 subnets.
- In the case an IP address lives outside the current subnet, the MAC address of the router is resolved, known as the _default gateway_

Subnets made great strides in the design (and scale) of inter-networking devices:

- The problem of _broadcast storms_ in layer 2 networks, as part of its inherent flood and learn model, still was a scalability pain point, even with concept of subnets.
- The need to further partition layer 2 networks was strong.
- The [VLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLAN) standard was born.
- VLANs by applying simple tags to layer 2 network frames, are able to further partition and limit the broadcast blast radius even further.
- Switches honour VLAN tags and will not broadcast frames between different VLANs.
- VLAN has a _trunk mode_ where it will freely broadcast through any layer 2 frames. This is to support advanced configurations where downstream appliances or hosts may wish to receive all layer 2 frames to make intelligent routing or filtering decisions.
- Operating systems support connecting a single NIC to multiple VLANs such as `eth0.1` `eth0.2` on Linux

Subnets use routers to inter-link them. But how do routers, which may in-turn be linked to many other routers, know where to send a packet onwards to the next part of its journey?

- Routing packets between subnets is akin to routing mail between inter-state post offices.
- Without hand configuring routing tables, a laborious and error prone activity, dynamic routing protocols were made.
- A router can advertise the subnet for which is knows about and is capable of routing.
- Using a routing protocol, routers can share this routing knowledge with each other.
- [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) or Border Gateway Protocol is one popular option.

| OSPF  | Open Shortest Path First                   | Routes based on link state route (LSR) (used inside a data center)   |

### Layer 4 (Transport)

Thankfully layer 3 provides the foundations for devices to communicate on a network.

Unfortunately we're not done.

When you think about a computer or device connected to a network, it is not uncommon for it to be running multiple processes that each in-turn wish to interact with the network. A given computer might run a web browser and SSH client simultanously.

- While layer 3 (IP) allows machine level packet exchange to take place, it is too crude for multiplexing this traffic between processes.
- Enter layer 4 which bolsters layer 3 (IP) with additional powers.
- Three key missing pieces are added on-top of IP; a _protocol field_ and two 16-bit _port fields_ for a source and destination port.
- 16-bit = 64K ports are possible
- [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml) (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) have estalbished common usages for particular port numbers.
- The source IP, dest IP, protocol, source port and dest port is known colloquially as the _5 tuple_
- The _5 tuple_ in essence defines the logical connection
- Sockets were an early layer 4 abstraction born in UNIX

#### TCP (tansmission control protocol):

- Provides the concept of a connection. A durable session is which data can flow.
- Establishing a TCP connection is infamously known as a _3-way handshake_ (`SYN`, `SYN-ACK`, `ACK`)
- On both the client and server accounting is established to facilitate re-ordering, acknowledging, congestion control and throttling, re-transmission, timeouts

At its core TCP fundamentals to know well (kudos [Chris Greer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQ9sgpkrX8)):

9:00 into https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQ9sgpkrX8

- TCP handshake and options
- TCP windows
- TCP retranmissions
- Selective acknowledgements

TCP tricks for performance issues:

- Creating a TCP profile, colors
- Filter expressions in wireshark
- Spotting delays in TCP streams


#### UDP (user datagram protocol):

- While TCP adds great functionality such as connection establishment, flow control etc.
- This comes at a cost and is trade-off that must be made.
- Do the features TCP provides outweight the performance costs it must pay?
- UDP strips down most of the functionality provided by TCP, providing minimal layer 4 communication between processes.
- Given how entrenched TCP is throughout the infrastructure that makes up the Internet, there is now a movement to evolve TCP by building protocols on-top of UDP.
- Google for example have been experimenting with [SPDY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY) and [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC)
- SPDY (a pre-cursor for HTTP/2) reduces latency between the browser and server by applying compression (less data), multiplexing (less connections) and prioritisation (less waiting).

#### Layer 4 (Transport) Protocols

| TLA  | Un-TLA                         | Description                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| QUIC | Quick UDP Internet Connections | An optimised TCP implementation based on UDP   |
| SPDY | _Speedy_                       | The precursor to HTTP/2.                       |
| TCP  | Transmission Control Protocol  | A connection-oriented transport protocol.      |
| UDP  | User Datagram Protocol         | A connection-less, minimal transport protocol. |

### Layer 7 (Application)

TCP connections at scale, don't scale.

- At Google scale, even the seemingly simple TCP 3-way handshake can be harmful.
- But given how entrenched the Internet infrastructure and its protocols are, it is simply not feasible to redesign TCP.
- Google, well aware of this problem, came up with a great idea.
- Why not build a _new TCP_ on-top of the unencumbered UDP; the [SPDY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY) and [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) proposals were born.
- SPDY (a pre-cursor for HTTP/2) reduces latency between the browser and server by applying compression (less data), multiplexing (less connections) and prioritisation (less waiting).

- HTTP/2 adds connection multiplexing; allowing multiple streams of data to traverse over a single connection. HTTP/2 overcomes [HOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking) at the layer 7, but still suffers from it as layer 4.
- HTTP/3 overcomes [HOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking) at layer 7 and layer 4 by using QUIC instead of TCP.
