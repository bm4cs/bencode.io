The VS11 beta includes a really slick cheatsheet style F# language reference. A gem for groking F# syntax.

The samples are grouped into modules. A module is just a collection of value, function and type definitions.

To execute the code in F# Interactive, highlight a line of code and then either type Alt-Enter, or right-click and choose "Send to Interactive".  To start F# Interactive, see the "View" menu.

For more about F#, see:

For templates to use with F#, see the 'Online Templates' in Visual Studio, 'New Project' > 'Online Templates'
