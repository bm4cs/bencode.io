[Oliver Powell](http://www.opowell.com/) put [this amazing original list](http://www.opowell.com/post/talks-that-changed-the-way-i-think-about-programming/) together in 2016. While I didn't appreciate the gravity of the list at the time, the talks have actually changed how I think about programming. Each of the presenters is not only incredibly intelligent but they have some serious credentials and achievements behind them. They in essence have much wisdom to impart. For example Rich Hickey, the creator of Closure, is brilliantly articulate and thought provoking.

I have started to sprinkle in other talks that have deeply impacted the way I think about software and complex systems. For example, [Bryan Cantrill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cantrill) from his Sun Microsystems fame most renown for DTrace, is perhaps my favourite computer scientist to watch. All of his talks are bursting with passion and wisdom.
