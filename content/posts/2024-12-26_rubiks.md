This algorithm is just muscle memory in my hands and wasn't as easy to explain in words as I thought. To help teach my 5yo nephew I wanted clear, simple steps. Some clever chap ? üß† came up with this which I learned an age ago.

### Step 1: Form a Daisy

1. Start by creating a white plus sign (the petals) on the yellow face (center).
2. Align each white petal's adjacent color with its matching middle-row center color.
3. Once matched, rotate the petal 180¬∞ to move it to the bottom face.
   - Repeat this process for all petals until you form a white cross on the bottom face.

### Step 2: Fill in the White Corners ("Chase the White Dogs")

1. Find any white corner pieces on the bottom layer (the "dogs").
2. Rotate the bottom layer to position a white corner directly below its matching color. For example, a white/green corner should be under the green side.
3. Bring the corner into the white face by rotating the side it‚Äôs under downward, ‚Äúscooping‚Äù the corner piece into place.
   - Repeat until the entire white face is completed, and the bottom row edges align with their center colors.

### Step 3: Solve the Middle Row

1. Identify edge pieces on the bottom layer that do **not** contain yellow (e.g., an orange/blue edge).
2. Determine the direction the piece needs to move: left or right.
3. Follow this sequence to place it:
   - Turn the bottom layer **away** from the target destination.
   - Rotate the bottom layer **towards** the destination.
   - Move the corresponding side of the middle layer **downward**.
   - Rotate the middle layer **toward** the destination.
   - Move the same side of the middle layer **upward**.
   - Restore the white cross if needed.
   - Repeat until all middle-row edges are in place.

### Step 4: Create a Yellow Plus

1. Use the **FUR-RUF** sequence:
   - **F**ront, **U**p, **R**ight, **R**ight, **U**p, **F**ront.
   - Repeat this pattern until you form a yellow cross on the top face.

---

### Step 5: Align the Yellow Corners ("Feed the Yellow Fish")

1. Look for a ‚Äúyellow fish‚Äù pattern on the top face (a yellow triangle or "arrow").
2. Perform this sequence:
   - Rotate the **Right** face **clockwise** twice.
   - Rotate the **Top** face **counter-clockwise** once.
   - Rotate the **Right** face **clockwise** again.
   - Rotate the **Top** face **clockwise** once.
   - Flip the cube so the yellow face remains on top, then rotate the **Top** face **counter-clockwise**.

---

### Step 6: Match Top Corners

1. Find two adjacent corners with matching side colors. Position them so they face the correct side.
2. Use this sequence to adjust the corners:
   - **Counter-clockwise**, **Clockwise**, **Counter-clockwise**, **Flip**, **Clockwise**, **Counter-clockwise**, **Counter-clockwise**, **Flip**, **Flip**.
   - Repeat as needed until all corners align with their sides.

---

### Step 7: Solve the Final Layer

1. Finish the cube with this sequence: **Flip**, **Clockwise** x3, **Counter-clockwise** x5, **Clockwise**, **Counter-clockwise**.
2. Adjust any remaining misaligned edges by repeating this pattern.
