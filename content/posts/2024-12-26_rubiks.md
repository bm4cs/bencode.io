This recipe is just muscle memory "in my hands", but my nephew asked me to explain the process...

---

### Step 1: Form a Daisy

1. Start by creating a white plus sign (the petals) on the yellow face (center).
2. Align each white petal's adjacent color with its matching middle-row center color.
3. Once matched, rotate the petal 180° to move it to the bottom face.
   - Repeat this process for all petals until you form a white cross on the bottom face.

---

### Step 2: Fill in the White Corners ("Chase the White Dogs")

1. Find any white corner pieces on the bottom layer (the "dogs").
2. Rotate the bottom layer to position a white corner directly below its matching color. For example, a white/green corner should be under the green side.
3. Bring the corner into the white face by rotating the side it’s under downward, “scooping” the corner piece into place.
   - Repeat until the entire white face is completed, and the bottom row edges align with their center colors.

### Step 3: Solve the Middle Row

1. Identify edge pieces on the bottom layer that do **not** contain yellow (e.g., an orange/blue edge).
2. Determine the direction the piece needs to move: left or right.
3. Follow this sequence to place it:
   - Turn the bottom layer **away** from the target destination.
   - Rotate the bottom layer **towards** the destination.
   - Move the corresponding side of the middle layer **downward**.
   - Rotate the middle layer **toward** the destination.
   - Move the same side of the middle layer **upward**.
   - Restore the white cross if needed.
   - Repeat until all middle-row edges are in place.

### Step 4: Create a Yellow Plus

1. Use the **FUR-RUF** sequence:
   - **F**ront, **U**p, **R**ight, **R**ight, **U**p, **F**ront.
   - Repeat this pattern until you form a yellow cross on the top face.

---

### Step 5: Align the Yellow Corners ("Feed the Yellow Fish")

1. Look for a “yellow fish” pattern on the top face (a yellow triangle or "arrow").
2. Perform this sequence:
   - Rotate the **Right** face **clockwise** twice.
   - Rotate the **Top** face **counter-clockwise** once.
   - Rotate the **Right** face **clockwise** again.
   - Rotate the **Top** face **clockwise** once.
   - Flip the cube so the yellow face remains on top, then rotate the **Top** face **counter-clockwise**.

### Step 6: Match Top Corners

Here’s an improved version of your Rubik’s Cube instructions, focusing on clarity, flow, and ensuring your nephew can follow along:

### Original draft

3. Form a daisy (a white plus with a yellow center)
4. For each white petal match its side color to its matching color on the middle row, then strip the petal with a half turn. You should now have a white plus.
5. Its time to fill any missing white corners. Chase the white dogs. Get any white squares on the bottom row (the dogs) and chase them around the bottom, until its paired color matches the middle of that side. For example a white/green needs to end up on the green side. Spin the top down and scoop up the dog. You should now a completely filled out white side.
6. Match center rows (none yellow squares). Now we work with the bottom layer to patch the middle row up. On the bottom layer find a cell that has no yellow on it (e.g. an orange/blue). It will either need to shift to the left or right. Here's the recipe: turn it away from the destination (e.g. if it needs to go left, turn it right), bottom layer go the same direction (e.g. right), the matching column goes down (e.g. right column down), middle layer turns the direction (e.g. to the right), turn the matching column up (e.g. the right column), then rematch the whites again. Rinse and repeat until the middle layer colors all match up.
7. Yellow plus (FUR-RUF = front, up, right, right, up, front)
8. Feed the yellow fish (clock, clock, counter then clock, clock, flip, counter)
9. Match top corners (counter, clock, counter, flip, clock, counter, counter, flip, flip)
10. Finish it (flip, clock x 3, counter x 5, clock, counter)
