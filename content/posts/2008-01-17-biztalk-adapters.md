This is an unusual one. Today I was faced by a general question from management on the kind of technology we are capable of integrating with. We use (and love) BizTalk. My initial thoughts were "BizTalk can integrate with anything"... failing that a built-in adapter could do the job, one could then look to purchasing a third-party adapter or even look at rolling one in-house. Adapters plumb data to and/or from a variety of different mediumsâ€”that more or less fall into one of four categories: line-of business system (eg. SAP, Business Application XYZ), middleware (eg. TIBCO) , transport (eg. WCF, file system) or database (eg. SQL Server, Oracle).

In my experience, I have never really had to deviate far from the "bread-and-butter" adapters (FILE, SOAP, WSE 2.0, SMTP, etc), so I found it rather enlightening to actually have a look at what's available out-of the box, what (some) third-party vendors are doing in the adapter space, and what options exist for hand-rolling.
