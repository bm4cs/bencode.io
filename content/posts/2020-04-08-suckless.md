The [suckless](https://suckless.org/) project values simplicity, clarity and frugality in software.

> Our philosophy is about keeping things simple, minimal and usable. We believe this should become the mainstream philosophy in the IT sector.

As a user of most of their programs including the infamous [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) (a tiling window manager), [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) (launcher), [st](https://st.suckless.org/) (terminal emulator) and others [tools](https://tools.suckless.org/), I can attest to benefits of using minimal and efficient software.

# Patching

Programs are customised by [patching](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/) the C source code. However, unlike typical open source projects, suckless source code is quite readable and hackable, a by-product of the philosophy.

> Because dwm is customized through editing its source code [C], it's pointless to make binary packages of it. This keeps its userbase small and elitist. No novices asking stupid questions.

Download a patch and apply it:

    patch -p1 -i cool-dwm-feature-i-need-20191002-b46028b.diff

The first few patches generally apply cleanly. After that, the base source code gets too frankensteined for `patch` to work with. Don't fear, manually applying the patches using your editor is quite enjoyable.

Some suckless conventions:

-   User configuration is defined in the `config.def.h` header. Always maintain this file and never `config.h` directly.
-   I patch the `clean` target in the `Makefile` to include a `@rm -f config.h`
-   When building always do a clean before running install, like this `make clean && sudo make install`
-   Don't use too many patches (i.e. stay vanilla as possible)
-   Get in the habit of applying the patches, as opposed to forking the git repo. Forking results in an unmaintainable mess that gets out of sync with upstream suckless changes.
-   Every so often `git pull` (or re-cloning if your too heavily patched) the latest fixes and enhancements, and re-patching.

# dwm

Tiling window manager. Ditch GNOME/KDE when you're ready to ascend.

Patches I use:

-   [`attachbottom`](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachbottom/) new windows attach to bottom of the stack (instead of top), and to me feels less obtrusive
-   [`center`](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/center/) adds the ability to centre floating windows, for example I like to have `pulsemixer` bound to a keybinding that just floats above everything when I want it
-   [`fullgaps`](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fullgaps/) configurable amount of padding between windows, including outer gaps (between client and screen frame)
-   [`pertag`](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag/) a per tag (virtual desktop) layout mode
-   [`warp`](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/warp/) move mouse cursor to center of currently focused window, nice for multi-monitor setup

`config.def.h` mods:

-   Change `MODKEY` to super key
-   Define the `HYPER` and `MEH` combinations for ergodox
-   Register launcher strings (`const char*`) for each program I want shortcuts for.
-   Register the above launcher strings to specific key bindings (e.g. HYPER + I will launch `pulsemixer` in a centered floating window).

# st

Terminal emulator.

Patches:

-   `nordtheme` color theme
-   `scrollback` ability to scoll using shift + page-up/down
-   `scollback-mouse` ability to scoll using shift + mouse-scroll

`config.def.h` mods:

-   set font string to `FuraCode Nerd Font:pixelsize=14:antialias=true:autohint=true`

# slock

A graphical lock screen.

Patches:

-   `messages` adds text based message
