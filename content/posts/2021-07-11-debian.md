Moving back to Debian, in the yearning for rock solid stability and a whole distribution that just works. Debian was the first GNU/Linux I ever used as a teenager back in late 90s, and I have fond memories of it.

Starting with the official [amd64 install guide](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/).

# Preparation

## Make USB key

Quickly [discovered](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/458038/load-missing-firmware-from-removable-media-debian) I want the [image](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/) that includes proprietary firmware, so I can get my (nasty) wifi card working as quickly as possible.
