Moving back to Debian, in the yearning for rock solid stability and a whole distribution that just works. Debian was the first GNU/Linux I ever used as a teenager back in late 90s, and I have fond memories of it.

Starting with the official [amd64 install guide](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/).

# Preparation

## Make USB key

Quickly [discovered](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/458038/load-missing-firmware-from-removable-media-debian) I want the [image](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/) that includes proprietary firmware, so I can get my (nasty) wifi card working as quickly as possible.


# Post boot

## Networking

```
vi /etc/network/interfaces
```

Add the following (ammend for your specific interface):

```
allow-hotplug wlp3s0
iface wlp3s0 inet dhcp
    wpa-ssid norm
    wpa-psk PUT_PASSWORD_HERE
```

Bring up the interface with `ifup wlp3s0`

Edit `/etc/apt/sources.list` and comment out the `cdrom` sourced entries.

Install some essentials, to persist network configuration:

```
apt update
apt install network-manager
apt install git
```

## sudo

Add users to `sudo` group, and register the group in `sudoers`:

```
usermod -aG sudo ben
visudo
```
