> Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applications. Automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.

With Ansible and its amazing [module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html) ecosystem, you describe _what_ needs to be accomplished (i.e. declarative), rather than describing _how_ to accomplish each step (i.e. imperative).

Ansible is Python 2 based and uses SSH to communicate with remote hosts; the only prerequisites.

# Development Setup

## LXC (Lexy) Primer

In [David Cohen's Ansible 2 course](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/ansible-2-beginners-video), to keep the lab setup clean, suggests the use of LXC containers; a light and convenient way of spinning up isolated operating environments. Using LXC scales nicely, even if you're not running Linux, simply create a single Linux VM (e.g. using Hyper-V, VirtualBox, VMWare). This single VM willbe capable of running several LXC containers.

LXC was first released in 2008, and is an OS level virtualisation method for running multiple Linux systems, using a single Linux kernel, and can underpin higher level layers such as Docker. To get going:

1. Install with `yum install epel-release` then `yum install lxc lxc-extra lxc-templates`. `lxc-extra` includes helpful scripts such as `lxc-ls`. Verify with `lxc-checkconfig`.
2. Create containers like this `lxc-create -t centos -n web1`. The container templates `-t` available can be found in `/usr/share/lxc/templates`. This will download the base file system for the chosen template, dumping it in /var/cache e.g. `/var/cache/lxc/centos/x86_64/7/`. A temporary root password to actually log into the container is placed here `/var/lib/lxc/web1/tmp_root_pass`.
3. Spark it up with `lxc-start -n ansibley -d`. The `-d` runs it in daemon mode, preventing it from taking over stdout and stdin.
4. Get a state of play with `lxc-ls -f`
5. When you're ready to jump into a container, `lxc-attach -n web1`
6. Ensure that Ansibles only dependency _python 2.7_ is on all participating machines. This can be done using a playbook, but keep things low tech for now. `lxc-attach` each container, and do a `yum install python27`.

## Installation

Bleeding edge:

    git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible
    cd ansible
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    dnf install python-jinja2 python-paramiko python-yaml sshpass
    source ./hacking/env-setup

### Target Machine Requirements

Only requirements are Python 2 and OpenSSH.

**Python 2**

If `python --version` doesn't spit out a sane version e.g. 2.7.5, then install it:

    yum install python

**OpenSSH**

CentOS `sshd` is already installed. To configure it:

1. `firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh`
1. `chkconfig sshd on`
1. `systemctl start sshd.service`
1. `netstat -tupln | grep :22`

**Static IP**

Edit `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` (or that relevent to the network device of concern):

    DEVICE=eth0
    BOOTPROTO=static
    IPADDR=192.168.124.122
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    HWADDR=52:54:00:55:1b:21
    ONBOOT=yes
    TYPE=Ethernet
    IPV6INIT=no

### SSH Security

Create `ansible` accounts on all participating nodes, and give it noprompt sudo.

    adduser ansible
    passwd ansible
    visudo

Below the root user specification add:

    ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

When running a playbook over SSH (e.g. from Jenkins or cron), to prevent credential prompts, ensure that the `ansible` user on the control node has a key pair (`/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa`), and that it is exchanged with all other partipating nodes:

    $ su - ansible
    $ ssh-keygen
    $ ssh-copy-id ansible@web1.bencode.net
    $ ssh-copy-id ansible@web2.bencode.net
    $ ssh-copy-id ansible@db1.bencode.net
    $ ssh-copy-id ansible@db2.bencode.net
    $ ssh-copy-id localhost #ssh needs this

Alternatively, on the controller, copy (clipboard) the public key:

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

And on the participating machines, copy and paste it into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

## ansible.cfg

The main configuration. The probe path to find one is:

1. Check the `Ansible_Config` env var.
2. Nope? `ansible.cfg` in current dir.
3. Nope? `ansible.cfg` in home dir.
4. Nope? `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

## Priming a target host

Typically new hosts need to be "primed" to support being an Ansible target; installing a Python 2 runtime, and bedding in the SSH public key of user that Ansible will be running under. Suprisingly this initial setup can itself be achieved using a playbook (tip: disabling `gather_facts` prevents Ansible reaching out to Python, which is non-existant at this point):

**prepare_ansible_target.yml**

````yaml
---
# Run with ansible-playbook <filename> -k
#   (make sure to add the IPs of machines you want to manage to /etc/ansible/hosts first)

- hosts: all
  gather_facts: False
  remote_user: oper01
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  become_method: sudo

  tasks:
    - name: Update Packages
      raw: (apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade)

    - name: Install Python 2
      raw: test -e /usr/bin/python || (apt-get update && apt-get install -y python)

    ```
    - name: Fancy way of doing authorized_keys
      authorized_key: user=ansible
                      exclusive=no
                      key="{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
     ```

    - name: COMMON | Set environment
      blockinfile:
        dest: /etc/environment
        block: |
          LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
          LANG=en_US.UTF-8
      register: newenv

    - block:
      - name: COMMON | Generate locales
        raw: locale-gen en_US.UTF-8

      - name: COMMON | Reconfigure locales
        raw: update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
      # only run this task block when we've just changed /etc/environment
      when: newenv.changed
````

## Hosts (Inventory) File

Ansible provides it own base inventory file at `/etc/ansible/hosts`, which is nicely documented. Create a new _inventory_ file in your working dir, similar to the following:

    [allservers]
    192.168.124.120
    192.168.124.121
    192.168.124.122

    [web]
    192.168.124.120
    192.168.124.121

    [db]
    192.168.124.122

Ansible can be pointed at specific inventory files with the `-i` switch like this:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory-file

# Adhoc Commands

A neat way of running one off tasks. Syntax is:

    ansible <group/machine> -m <module> -a <args> [-k for pass prompt]

## Examples

Run an adhoc one liner:

    $ ansible allservers -a "uname -a" -i inventory
    192.168.124.120 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
    Linux web1.local 3.10.0-229.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Mar 6 11:36:42 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

    192.168.124.122 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
    Linux server1.example.com 3.10.0-693.11.6.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Jan 4 01:06:37 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

    192.168.124.121 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
    Linux web2.local 3.10.0-229.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Mar 6 11:36:42 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Very nice. This scales to any task, such as registering the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) package repo for the fleet of servers.

    $ ansible web -a "wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm" -i inventory

Ansible has an insane library of [modules](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html) for accomplishing most tasks. Lets take the [ping](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ping_module.html) module for a run on a specific host (this is not an actual ICMP ping, but does verify Ansible is able to run on the target):

    $ ansible 192.168.124.120 -m ping -i inventory
    192.168.124.120 | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }

Install nginx across all hosts in the web group, using the [package](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/package_module.html) module. The `-b` switch here is the _become_ option, which will by default elevate to root using `su`.

    $ ansible web -m package -a "name=nginx state=installed" -i inventory -b
    192.168.124.121 | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": true,
        "msg": "warning: /var/cache/yum/x86_64/7/base/packages/libunwind-1.2-2.el7.x86_64.rpm: Header V3 RSA/SHA256
    ...omitted...

Now run a one liner `yum` on every server to check `nginx` is indeed installed- only the two web hosts should return SUCCESS:

    $ ansible allservers -a "yum list installed nginx" -i inventory
    [WARNING]: Consider using yum module rather than running yum

    192.168.124.121 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>

    Installed Packages
    nginx.x86_64                        1:1.12.2-2.el7                         @epel

    192.168.124.120 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>

    192.168.124.122 | FAILED | rc=1 >>
    Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacksError: No matching Packages to listnon-zero return code

Showing off the `-B` (timeout) and `-P` (poll time) arguments:

    ansible allservers -B 2400 -P 5 -a "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y" -u root

# Playbooks

Core concepts:

- **Tasks**: an individual piece of desired state, such as ensuring the latest version of a package is installed. If useful tasks can be grouped into _blocks_.
- **Templates**: a base file that can have state injected into it, annotated with handlebar style tags thanks to the [Jinja template engine](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) e.g. `{{ site_name }}`
- **Handlers**: a hook that is triggered as late in the playbook run as possible (e.g. if multiple handlers to restart nginx are wired up, Ansible will minimise the number of restarts by deferring the trigger until the very last task that requires a restart is complete).
- **Roles**: clumps of reusable tasks, templates and handlers; allowing higher level of abstraction (e.g. the web role, caching role, database role and so on).

Playbooks are run with the `ansible-playbook` command, like so:

    ansible-playbook configure_fleet.yml -i inventory

## Playbook Structure

As your Ansible project grows, a common tree structure to help keep things organised is as follows:

    playbook.yml              # top level playbook
    group_vars/
        all                   # the main file for defining variables
    roles/
        role1/                # each role (e.g. web, database, common, cache)
            files/            # role-specific files which will be copied to the remote machine
            handlers/         # role-specific handlers
                main.yml      # handler file
            meta/             # files that establish role dependencies
            tasks/            # role-specific tasks
                main.yml      # task file
            templates/        # role-specific templates
            vars              # role-specific variables, although recommended to use group_vars/all instead

As you would expect, this takes advantage of some of Ansibles default path probing, such as the top level `group_vars` containing global variable definitions, `templates` contain jinja2 templates resolvable when using the `template` module, and so on.

Dave has put together two (one in pure Python and one in Ansible) [handy scripts](https://github.com/groovemonkey/hands-on-ansible/blob/master/02-playbooks/01-playbook-structure/create_playbook.py) for generating this tree. The vanilla Python version needs a destination directory, and one or more role names, for example:

    ./create_playbook.py ./boilerplate-playbook web database common

A real world playbook (`playbook.yml`) might look like this:

```yaml
---
- name: Database Setup
  hosts: dbservers
  remote_user: ansible
  roles:
    - common
    - database

- name: Web Server Setup
  hosts: webservers
  remote_user: ansible
  roles:
    - common
    - web
```

Sample handlers in `/roles/role1/handlers/main.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: reload nginx
  service: name=nginx state=reloaded

- name: reload systemd
  command: systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Tasks

A single chore to be acheived. Here are a few tasks:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: NGINX | Remove default vhost
    file: path=/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default state=absent

  - name: NGINX | Start
    service: name=nginx state=started
    register: nginx_started

  - name: STAT | Check dir exists
    stat: path={{ foo_directory }}
    register: foo_directory
```

The third task highlights the ability to store the result of a task in a variable, in this case the `stat` task result, which could be used for a conditional `when` directive like so:

    when: foo_directory.stat.exists == False

## Blocks

Tasks can be grouped into _blocks_, for example:

```yaml
- block:
    - name: PostgreSQL | Setup pg_hba.conf, allow connections from web servers
      template: src=pg_hba.conf dest={{ PGA_HB_CONF }}
      notify:
        - restart postgres
    - name: PostgreSQL | Listen on all IPs
      lineinfile:
        dest: "{{ PG_CONF }}"
        line: listen_addresses='*'
      notify:
        - restart postgres
  rescue:
    - name: Only run when a task blows up
      debug: msg="boom!"
  always:
    - name: Always always run
      debug: msg="Regardless of what happened, I'm running"
  when: hostvars[groups['webservers][0]]['inventory_hostname'] != inventory_hostname
```

Blocks can be a useful way to deal with control flow, exceptions and cleanup. They always start with the `block` keyword, and support the `rescue` and `always` hooks.

## Templates (Jinja2)

For templating Ansible leverages the Python [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) templating engine.

### Syntax

- `{% ... %}` for statements
- `{{ ... }}` for expressions to print to the template output
- `{# ... #}` for comments not included in the template output
- `# ... ##` for line statements

In action snippet:

```
local all postgres peer

    {% for host in groups['webservers'] %}
    host all all {{ hostvars[host]['inventory_hostname']}}/32 md5
    {% endfor %}

```

### Loops

Great support for [control structures](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#list-of-control-structures) exists, supporting the vanilla Python style `for...in` loop:

```jinja
{# A list of webservers #}
{% for server in groups['webservers'] %}
web{{ loop.index }}.bm4cs.io
{% endfor %}

{# A navigation menu #}
<nav class="menu">
  <ul>
    {% for item in navigation %}
      <li><a href="{{ item.href }}">{{ item.label }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</nav>

```

### Filters

Jinja2 [filters](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#builtin-filters) are (awesome!!) built-in functions available to all templates. String functions, list and general collection functions, arithmetic, and many more.

**groupby**

```jinja
<ul>
{% for group in persons|groupby('gender') %}
    <li>{{ group.grouper }}<ul>
    {% for person in group.list %}
        <li>{{ person.first_name }} {{ person.last_name }}</li>
    {% endfor %}</ul></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```

**join**

```jinja
{{ [1, 2, 3]|join('|') }}
    -> 1|2|3

{{ [1, 2, 3]|join }}
    -> 123

{ webservers|join(', ') }}
```

### Escaping

When you just want to dump out something completely, put them inbetween some `raw` and `endraw` tags.

## Variables and Facts

Variables are scoped as Global (visible across playbooks), Per-Play and Per-Host. They are defined using the `register` keyword, and referenced with `{{ varname }}` double handlebars style syntax.

Some common ways to define variables:

- `--extra-vars` on the command line
- in the playbook as `vars:`
- in the `global_vars/all` file
- import a YAML file full of variables with `include_vars: foo_vars.yml`
- host or host group scoped vars can be defined in the inventory
- role specific vars in `/role/rolename/vars/`

The existance of variables can be tested with a `when`:

    - name: Check foo_var is defined
      debug: msg="Yes, foo_var is defined"
      when: foo_var is defined

Ansible will probe hosts defined in the inventory, and sniff out "facts" about them. Why is this useful? The `package` module for example, allows you to work with packages in an agnostic manner, insulating you from the nuances of `yum`, `apt`, `package`, `pacman` or whatever whacky package manager of the day is. Thanks to facts, the package module can dynamically target a variety of package managers and operating systems.

Facts can be leveraged throughout plays, and are represented as a dictionary called `hostvars` (e.g. `hostvars[host]['fact_name']`). Fact gathering can be disabled `gather_facts: False` at the playbook level; this will break modules (such as `package`) that rely on facts.

**Useful tip**: The [setup](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/modules/setup_module.html#setup-module) module, which is implicitly invoked by playbooks to do fact gathering, can be manually called to dump facts to stdout.

    ansible allservers -m setup -i inventory

Some fact testing examples:

```yaml
- name: All the things
  debug: msg={{ hostvars[inventory_hostname] }}

    - name: However this machine is listed in the inventory
      debug: msg={{ inventory_hostname }}

    - name: Just the hostname
      debug: msg={{ ansible_hostname }}

    - name: Just the primary IPv4 address
      debug: msg={{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_default_ipv4']['address'] }}

```

### Built-in Variables

- `hostvars`: access facts and variables from other hosts (for current host key the dictionary on `inventory_hostname`)
- `group_names`: list of groups current host is a member of
- `groups`: all groups in the inventory
- `inventory_hostname`: current hostname that ansible is executing tasks on
- `environment`:

### Task Results and Control Flow

The outcome of a task can be set as a variable using `register`, for example:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: start nginx
    service: name=nginx state=started
    register: nginx_started
```

The resulting data structure can be used for making downstream decisions:

```yaml
- stat: path={{ app_dir }}
  register: app_dir

- name: Another task
  module: arg1=123 arg2=456
  when: app_dir.stat.exists == False
```

### Globally Scoped

For globally scoped variables, use the `group_vars/all` YAML file, for example:

```yaml
---
aws_region: ap-southeast-2
aws_pubkey_name: "vim-ansible"

db_master_name: "ThinkDb"
db_master_user: "su"
db_master_pass: "chaching"
db_conn_string: "Initial Catalog={{ db_master_name }}; User={{ db_master_user }}; Password={{ db_master_password }}"
```

### Playbook Scoped

As `vars:` above the task blocks.

```yaml
--
- hosts: web
  vars:
    site_name: "benjansible"
    site_title: "Hope."
    site_url: "www.bencode.net"

  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx.
      package: name=nginx state=latest
```

### Inventory File Variables

    [webservers]
    web1.evilcorp.com server_name="yin.evilcorp.com"
    web2.evilcorp.com server_name="yang.evilcorp.com"

    [webservers:vars]
    web_home_path=/var/www/home/

### Command Line Vars

Using `--extra-vars` during invocation. This will clobber/override any variables that may get defined with the same name. It can accept space delimitered strings (example below), or quoted JSON.

    ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml --extra-vars "version=1.01 website_url=www.bencode.io"

## Control Flow

### when

Task runs if the "when" clause is truthy. Supported [tests](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#builtin-tests) are consistent with Jinja2.

```yaml
- name: If host uses systemd, create unit file
  template: src=foo.service dest=/etc/systemd/system/foo.service
  when: systemd_installed.stat.exists
```

```yaml
block:
  - name: PostgreSQL | Setup pg_hba.conf, allow connections from web servers
    template: src=pg_hba.conf dest={{ PGA_HB_CONF }}
    notify:
      - restart postgres
  - name: PostgreSQL | Listen on all IPs
    lineinfile:
      dest: "{{ PG_CONF }}"
      line: listen_addresses='*'
    notify:
      - restart postgres
when: hostvars[groups['webservers][0]]['inventory_hostname'] != inventory_hostname
```

### register

Stores the output of a task into a variable. Useful for downstream control flow.

```yaml
- stat: path=/var/www/public/foo
  register: foo_web_dir

- shell: whoami
  register: user_name
```

Consuming variables is easy with double handlebar syntax:

```jinja
{{ user_name.stdout }}
{{ user_name.stderr }}
{{ foo_web_dir.stat.exists == False }}
```

### Iteration

When iterators (e.g. `with_items`, `with_dict`) are used with a `when`, the `when` is evaluated for each item.

#### with_items

Iterates over a list:

```yaml
- name: Install essentials
  package: name={{ item }} state=present
  with_items:
    - wget
    - vim
    - curl
    - tmux
```

Supports list variables too.

```
with_items: "{{ my_list }}"
```

#### with_dict

Iterates over a YAML hash:

```yaml
---
fruits:
  banana:
    awesome: 7
    cals: 89
  kiwi:
    awesome: 6
    cals: 61
  apple:
    awesome: 10
    cals: 52
```

Using `with_dict` like this:

```- name: Fruit pondering
debug: var="{{ item.key }} is {{ item.value.awesome }} out of 10, and has about {{ item.value.cals }} per serve."
with_dict: "{{ fruits }}"
```

#### with_nested

Nested loops.

```yaml
- name: Give users access to multiple databases
  mysql_user: name={{ item[0] }} priv={{ item[1] }}.\*:ALL append_privs=yes password=foo
  with_nested:
    - ["alice", "bob", "dave"]
    - ["clientdb", "employeedb", "providerdb", "testdb"]
```

### changed_when

Gives you finer grained control over how a task reports that it has indeed changed. Some modules like `raw` or `shell` always report a change, because Ansible doesn't actually know if they resulted in a side effect or not.

```yaml
- command: "apt-get upgrade -y"
  register: apt_upgrade
  changed_when: "'0 upgraded, 0 newly installed' not in apt_upgrade.stdout"
```

### failed_when

Same idea as `changed_when`, when its not clear if a task actually succeeded or failed:

```yaml
- command: "ls /foo/bar/baz"
  register: listing_output
  failed_when: "'baz' not in listing_output.stderr"
  ignore_errors: yes
```

When you actually expect a task to produce `stderr`, you can ignore them with `ignore_errors`.

## Execution Strategies

The approach Ansible will take to run plays across hosts.

### Serial (default)

One task at a time, across all servers. A `serial` argument allows you to define a batch size either as an absolute number or a percentage.

    name: Do things 2 servers at a time
    hosts: middleware-servers
    serial: 2

Or a percentage:

    name: Do stuff on 30% of servers at a time
    hosts: web-servers
    serial: 30%

And finally multiple batch sizes are supported:

    name: Do tasks on a single server, then 5 servers, then 10% of the servers
    hosts: web-servers
    serial:
      - 1
      - 5
      - 10%

### Free (go nuts)

Provided enough resources, will go full throttle on hosts as fast as possible.

    - hosts: all
      strategy: free
      tasks:

### Failure Percentage

If a certain failure threshold is met (e.g. 5%), abort everything.

    - hosts: nodejs-servers
      max_fail_percentage: 5
      serial:
        - 10%

# Modules

Ansible provides a [HUGE](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_all_modules.html) ecosystem of modules. A module is specified after a given tasks` name, for example:

```yaml
---
- hosts: webserver
  vars:
    site_url: bm4cs.io
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      package: name=nginx state=latest

    - name: Create website dir
      file: path="/var/www/{{ site_name }}" state=directory mode=0755

    - name: Create nginx config
      template:
        src: "templates/website.conf"
        dest: "/etc/nginx/conf.d/{{ site_name }}.conf"
      notify:
        - restart nginx
```

Can see the `package`, `file` and `template` modules in action, and the arguments they are fed.

## Bread & Butter Modules

### Package Management

Could use `pacman`, `apt`, `yum`, `pkg`, `rpm` directly, dont. Use [package](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/package_module.html#package) instead.

### Files and Directories

- `template`: run a jinja template, and copy the result to a location
- `file`: CRUD files and directories. Important properties, are `state` (file, link, directory, hard, touch, absent) state=absent will delete, `recurse`,
- `lineinfile` and `blockinfile`: insert/update/remove a line (or block) of text content.
- `copy`: copying local files to target/s
- `fetch`: copying remote files from target/s to local
- `stat`: existance check

### System

- `service`: service management agnostic of init system (e.g. SysV, systemd, upstart). The `state` property (started, stopped, restarted, reloaded).
- `user`
- `group`
- `cron`
- `hostname`
- `authorized_keys`: asserts the existance of, if not adds.
- `iptables`: managing rules
- `modprobe`: kernel mods
- `kernel_blacklist`
- `gluster_volume`
- `lvm`
- `zfs`

### Miscellaneous

- `raw`: invokes a down and dirty SSH command
- `synchronize`: basically rsync
- `get_url`: can pull from lots of protos (http, ftp, and more)
- `unarchive`: unpack things on target/s
- `ec2`: AWS compute management
- `rds`: AWS DB management
- `lxc_container`: manage all things LXC container related

# Debugging

The `debug` module to the rescue.

    - name: Debugging dude
      debug: msg="Boom boom!"

Debug and `register` compliment each other, when you want to verify what data structure a task is outputting.

    - shell: /usr/bin/uptime
      register: tehuptime

    - name: Debug uptime
      debug: var=tehuptime

## Verbosity

A really handy way to dig into the underlying commands that Ansible actually throws at the inventory hosts, is by enabling _very very verbose_ logging. When running Ansible can pass the `-v` or `-vv` or the very very verbose `-vvv` options.

The `debug` module supports filtering on the verbosity level:

    - name: Debug verbosity 1
      debug: var=myuptime verbosity=1

    - name: Debug verbosity 2
      debug: var=myuptime verbosity=2

    - name: Debug verbosity 3
      debug: var=myuptime verbosity=3

# Working Example Notes

## Document!

Documenting what the playbook expects in `group_vars/all` is a good practice, for example:

    # Exactly one database server
    # One or more web server/s
    # systemd on the web server/s

Allowing the playbook to make some assumptions can greatly simplify things. For example, knowing that we are dealing with a single DB server, enables us to use the IP of the first DB server in inventory, for later binding into our web servers database connection strings, example:

```
db_server: "{{ hostvars[groups['dbservers'][0]]['ansible_default_ipv4']['address'] }}"
```

## Same Host Multiple Roles

The same host can act as multiple roles, example:

    [web]
    10.1.3.1

    [database]
    10.1.3.1

## Variable Things

It's fine to consume variables just after declaring them, example:

```
PG_VERSION: "9.3"
PG_HBA_CONF: /etc/postgresql/{{ PG_VERSION }}/main/pg_hba.conf
```
