## Purpose

A guide on the C# lang and its evolution, with less focus on its runtime .NET.

Coming to C# cold or from other langs, there is commonly shock at just how interwoven the toolchain (Visual Studio, msbuild), the runtime (.NET) and the language (C#) are.

For example, you can't use C# 10 on .NET Framework 4.7, you can't use C# 8 in Visual Studio 2010 and so on. Thankfully, cleaner separation between these pieces (the lang, the runtime and the toolchain) is occuring under the unified .NET umbrella.



## C# language versioning

Target framework	version	C# language version default
.NET	6.x	C# 10
.NET	5.x	C# 9.0
.NET Core	3.x	C# 8.0
.NET Core	2.x	C# 7.3
.NET Standard	2.1	C# 8.0
.NET Standard	2.0	C# 7.3
.NET Standard	1.x	C# 7.3
.NET Framework	all	C# 7.3


## C# 1.0 (2002)

1.0 was spartan compared to what it is today and was verbose to use. It was however a viable alternative to Java on the Windows platform 20 years ago. 1.0 provided the foundational language constructs we use today:

- Classes
- Structs
- Interfaces
- Events
- Properties
- Delegates
- Operators and expressions
- Statements
- Attributes

## C# 2.0 (2005)

- Generics
- Partial types
- Anonymous methods
- Nullable value types
- Iterators
- Covariance and contravariance
- Getter/setter separate accessibility
- Method group conversions (delegates)
- Static classes
- Delegate inference

## C# 3.0 (2007)

- Auto-implemented properties
- Anonymous types
- Query expressions
- Lambda expressions
- Expression trees
- Extension methods
- Implicitly typed local variables
- Partial methods
- Object and collection initializers
