_Updated: 2020-10-31_

About a year ago I finally bit the bullet and commited to learning a real text editor. I went with Vim. Once you break through its initial steep learning curve, its truly life changing. Level up to text surgeon today.

I usually clone my `dotfiles` git repo straight into my home directory i.e. `~/dotsfiles`. A couple of symlinks later, I'm away:

    ln -nfs ~/dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -nfs ~/dotfiles/vim ~/.vim

Vim is incredibly customisable. Its important to take the time to craft your own [`vimrc`](https://github.com/bm4cs/dots/blob/master/stow-home/neovim/.config/nvim/init.vim). Type `:options` to understand the various levers you can pull to make Vim your editor.

# Help

Vim has brilliant built-in help. Its only one `:help` away, `:h operator` or `:h motion`.

-   `:h cmd` normal mode _cmd_ help
-   `:h i_cmd` insert mode _cmd_ help
-   `:h v_cmd` visual mode _cmd_ help
-   `:h c_cmd` command line _cmd_ help

# Operators

| Trigger | Effect                                              |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `c`     | change                                              |
| `d`     | delete                                              |
| `y`     | yank                                                |
| `g~`    | swap case                                           |
| `gu`    | lower case                                          |
| `gU`    | upper case                                          |
| `g?`    | [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encode |
| `>`     | shift right                                         |
| `<`     | shift left                                          |
| `=`     | autoindent                                          |
| `!`     | filter through a program                            |

See `:h operator` for more. All of these support being combined with a motion (or a visual mode selection). Some examples:

-   gUaw - make a word shout case
-   dap - delete entire paragraph
-   g?ap - ROT13 encode paragraph
-   gUgU - shout case entire line (factoid: when two operators are invoked in duplicate, applies to current line)

# Object Selection

Learning object selectors is one of the best ways of becoming more efficient with Vim. Commands that start with `i` select inner objects without white space, and thus always select less text than their `a` equivalents. When you discover these can be paired with _operators_ (discussed above), _life changing_, e.g. `daw` delete a word, `gUis` uppercase inner sentence, and so on.

| Selector  | Effect                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `aw`      | a word                                    |
| `iw`      | inner word                                |
| `as`      | a sentence                                |
| `is`      | inner sentence                            |
| `ap`      | a paragraph                               |
| `ip`      | inner paragraph                           |
| `a]` `a[` | a `[]` block                              |
| `i]` `i[` | inner `[]` block                          |
| `a)` `a(` | a block                                   |
| `i)` `i(` | inner block                               |
| `a>` `a<` | a `<>` block                              |
| `i>` `i<` | inner `<>` block                          |
| `at`      | tag block, as in XML tags `<a>` to `</a>` |
| `it`      | inner tag block                           |
| `a}` `a{` | a `{}` block                              |
| `i}` `i{` | inner `{}` block                          |
| `a"` `a'` | quoted string including back ticks        |
| `i"` `i'` | quoted string including back ticks        |

# Windows

Leverage the built-in windows manager, which can do splits to view multiple files at the same time.

-   `:sp` horizontal split
-   `:vs` vertical split
-   `ctrl+w o` - close all windows other than the active one.
-   `ctrl+w x` - exchange active window with the next one.
-   `ctrl+w c` - close the current window.
-   `ctrl+w r` - rotate windows clockwise (or counter clockwise).

# The Edit (e) Command

Vim's built-in edit command, will present you with a nice file system explorer, for example `:e .` to present the current working directory.

# Cool Things

## relativenumber

Makes line numbering relative. So good! Makes it fast to figure out how many lines up or down you need to move, to get to the line you want. Example, `14j` to jump 14 lines down.

      2 I usually clone my `scripts` git repo straight into my home
      1 ¬
    13      ln -nfs ~/git/scripts/linux/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc¬
      1     ln -nfs ~/git/scripts/linux/vim ~/.vim¬
      2 ¬
      3 Vim has brilliant built-in help. Its only one `:help` away.

## Escalated Save

Editing a file, but don't have privileges to save.

    :w !sudo tee %

`:w` writes to `sudo tee %`. `tee` flows the output of the file write to `%`, the name of the current file. I have a handy key binding `w!!` to do this:

    cmap w!! w !sudo tee %

# Plugins

While core Vim functionality is like a rock, changing rarely, the plugin eco-system is where you can make Vim level up to doing tasks you commonly do with it. Consequently plugin selection can be quite personal based on specific langs one works with.

The Vim community seems obsessed with writing new plug-in managers, there's quite a bit of choice and tradeoffs, I have used a few in the past (Pathogen, Vundle) and as of 2020 have settled with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), which balances minimalism and functionality nicely.

Coming from bloated power tool IDE's like awesome JetBrains tools, in order to be remotely productive, I need to be able to efficiency locate and jump between files within a large code base.

## NERDTree (file browsing)

[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) add's a file system tree pane to Vim (like _Open Folder_ in VSCode). Personally I find fuzzy finding with [denite](https://github.com/Shougo/denite.nvim) and [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to be more efficient at jumping between files, but NERDTree is handy when it comes to browsing a code base.

NERDTree keyboard customisations:

    " Toggle NERDTree on/off
    nmap <leader>n :NERDTreeToggle<CR>

    " Opens current file location in NERDTree
    nmap <leader>f :NERDTreeFind<CR>

    " PageDown
    noremap <Space> <PageDown>

    " PageUp
    noremap - <PageUp>

NERDTree general customisations:

    let g:NERDTreeShowHidden = 1 "show hidden files
    let g:NERDTreeMinimalUI = 1 " remove bookmarks and help text
    let g:NERDTreeDirArrowExpandable = '⬏' "custom icons for expandable
    let g:NERDTreeDirArrowCollapsible = '⬎' "custom icons for expandable
    let g:NERDTreeIgnore = ['^\.DS_Store$', '^tags$', '\.git$[[dir]]', '\.idea$[[dir]]', '\.sass-cache$'] "ignore list

## coc (Conquer of Completion)

> It's a completion framework and language server client which supports extension features of VSCode.

Like VSCode, Emacs and many others, can sit upon the [Langserver.org](https://langserver.org/) Protocol (LSP) originally created by Microsoft, to provide language aware intelligence such as auto complete, go to definition and find all references.

To install a coc extension that supports a language, have a look on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Acoc.nvim) for one, and install with `CocInstall` for example to install Go language completion `CocInstall coc-gocode`. Make sure to also install [gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode) for this particular plugin, with a quick `go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode`.

### Go support

You can manually register LSP servers in jsonc format in the `~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json` (use `:CocConfig` to auto jump you to this file). For example, the below registers `gopls`, Google's offical LSP for golang:

    {
      "languageserver": {
        "golang": {
          "command": "gopls",
          "args": [],
          "rootPatterns": ["go.mod", ".vim/", ".git/", ".hg/"],
          "filetypes": ["go"]
        }
      }
    }

### Web dev (JS, ES6 and CSS)

    :CocInstall coc-tsserver coc-eslint coc-json coc-prettier coc-css

## Denite (and ripgrep)

Fuzzy finder. Very customisable, for example, mine is configured to use [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). What is ripgrep?

> ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect your .gitignore and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files.

In my `.vimrc`:

    " Use ripgrep in place of "grep"
    call denite#custom#var('grep', 'command', ['rg'])

    " Custom options for ripgrep
    "   --vimgrep:  Show results with every match on it's own line
    "   --hidden:   Search hidden directories and files
    "   --heading:  Show the file name above clusters of matches from each file
    "   --S:        Search case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase
    call denite#custom#var('grep', 'default_opts', ['--hidden', '--vimgrep', '--heading', '-S'])

    " Recommended defaults for ripgrep via Denite docs
    call denite#custom#var('grep', 'recursive_opts', [])
    call denite#custom#var('grep', 'pattern_opt', ['--regexp'])
    call denite#custom#var('grep', 'separator', ['--'])
    call denite#custom#var('grep', 'final_opts', [])
