Dale Carnegie's flagship "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is a foundational book on communication, relationship-building, and personal effectiveness. First published in 1936, its principles remain relevant for anyone seeking to improve their social skills, leadership, and influence.

## Key Lessons

- **Avoid criticism and condemnation**: Criticizing others rarely leads to positive change; instead, seek to understand and encourage.
- **Make the other person feel important**: Offer sincere appreciation and recognition.
- **Show genuine interest in others**: Listen actively, ask questions, and remember people's names to make them feel valued.
- **Smile and be positive**: A simple smile and a positive attitude can open doors and create goodwill.
- **Be a good listener**: Encourage others to talk about themselves and their interests.
- **Talk in terms of the other person's interests**: Frame conversations around what matters to others.
- **Admit your mistakes quickly**: Taking responsibility builds trust and respect.
- **Let the other person save face**: Be tactful and considerate in difficult situations.

## Core Concepts

### If you want honey, don't kick the beehive - avoid criticism

**Don't criticize, condemn or complain**

### The big secret of people - appreciation

**Give honest and sincere appreciation**

> John Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once confessed, "I learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence."

> Hans Selye, another great psychologist, said, "As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation." The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.

> Any fool can criticize, condemn or complain - and most fools do. "A great man shows his greatness," said Carlyle, "by the way he treats little men."

Instead of condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try to figure out why they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism, and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness.

> "To know all is to forgive all"

> "Don't be afraid of the enemies who attack you. Be affraid of the friends who flatter you." - General Alvaro Obregon

We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem? We provide them with roast beef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect to give them kind words of appreciation that would sing in their memories for years like the music of the morning stars.

> "Don't critize, instead be hearty in appropbation and lavish in praise" - Charles Schwab

### Those who can do this have the whole world - arose eagerness

**Arouse in the other person an eager want**

Prime hook with the tastiest bait for its audience.

The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

> "Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire, and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way." - Harry A. Overstreet

Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself:

> "How can I make this person want to do it?"

Always frame a situation around what's in it for them. Such as getting a kindergartener excited about their first day and what they will get out of it; finger painting, new friends, etc.

> "If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.” - Henry Ford

The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. , a noted lawyer and

> “People who can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.” - Owen D. Young (one of America’s great business leaders)

When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own;
they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.

### Do this and be welcome anywhere - be interested in others

**Become genuinely interested in other people**

People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in themselves—morning, noon and after dinner.

> You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

> “It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.” - Alfred Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist

Be genuinely interested in others.

> “I looked at him with surprise and asked him what had happened since my visit only a few hours earlier. He pointed to the young man at the soda fountain and said that after I had left, the boy had come over and said that I was one of the few salespeople that called on the store that even bothered to say hello to him and to the others in the store. He told the owner that if any salesperson deserved his business, it was I. The owner agreed and remained a loyal customer. I never forgot that to be genuinely interested in other people is a most important quality for a salesperson to possess—for any person, for that matter.”

If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to do things for other people—things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.

> "I had made more headway in two hours by becoming genuinely interested in him and his problems than I could have made in ten years trying to get him interested in me and my product."

> “We are interested in others when they are interested in us.” - Publilius Syrus, famous Roman poet

### Make a good first impression - smile

Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says:

> "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you"

> "After he started on the job, I asked him why he had chosen us over the others. He paused 'I think it was because managers in the other companies spoke on the phone in a cold, business-like manner, which made me feel like just another business transaction. Your voice sounded as if you were glad to hear from me...that you really wanted me to be part of your organization.'"

You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.

The ultimate human survival guide in a nutshell:

> “I have also eliminated criticism from my system. I give appreciation and praise now instead of condemnation. I have stopped talking about what I want. I am now trying to see the other person’s viewpoint. And these things have literally revolutionized my life. I am a totally different man, a happier man, a richer man, richer in friendships and happiness - the only things that matter much after all.”

> "most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be" - Abe Lincoln

#### Mini essay by Elbert Hubbard

Whenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would like to do; and then, without veering off direction, you will move straight to the goal. Keep your mind on the great and splendid things you would like to do, and then, as the days go gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing upon the opportunities that are required for the fulfillment of your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running tide the element it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual...Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude—the attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered. We become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis.

### Don't be headed for trouble - names

**Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language**

Jim Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together.

> "the President was extremely pleasant and cheerful. He called me by name, made me feel very comfortable, and particularly impressed me with the fact that he was vitally interested in things I had to show him and tell him." - Chamberlain writes about Roosevelt

Franklin D. Roosevelt knew that one of the simplest, most obvious and most important ways of gaining good will was by remembering names and making people feel important—yet how many of us do it?

One of the first lessons a politician learns is this:

> “To recall a voter’s name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion.”

### Become a good conversationalist - listen

**Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves**

Harvard president Charles W. Eliot himself was a past master of the art of listening. Henry James recalled:

> “Dr. Eliot’s listening was not mere silence, but a form of activity. Sitting very erect on the end of his spine with hands joined in his lap, making no movement except that he revolved his thumbs around each other faster or slower, he faced his interlocutor and seemed to be hearing with his eyes as well as his ears. He listened with his mind and attentively considered what you had to say while you said it. At the end of an interview the person who had talked to him felt that he had had his say.”

Most people are motivated by the need to feel important.

> "But in reality, what he had really wanted was a feeling of importance. He got this feeling of importance at first by kicking and complaining. But as soon as he got his feeling of importance from a representative of the company, his imagined grievances vanished into thin air."

People crave a good listener.

> "Lincoln hadn’t wanted advice. He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic listener to whom he could unburden himself. That’s what we all want when we are in trouble. That is frequently all the irritated customer wants, and the dissatisfied employee or the hurt friend."

Most people are bores, that like to talk about themselves, intoxicated with their own egos, drunk with a sense of their own importance.

People who talk only of themselves think only of themselves.

> "Those people who think only of themselves are hopelessly uneducated. They are not educated, no matter how instructed they may be." - Dr Nicholas Murray Butler, longtime president of Columbia University

### How to interest people - others interests

Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested.

> “Think of it! I had been drumming at that man for four years—trying to get his business - and I’d still be drumming at him if I hadn’t finally taken the trouble to find out what he was interested in, and what he enjoyed talking about.”
