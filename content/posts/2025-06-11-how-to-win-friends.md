2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.
3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.

> John Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once confessed, "I learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence."

> Hans Selye, another great psychologist, said, "As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation." The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.

> Any fool can criticize, condemn or complain - and most fools do. "A great man shows his greatness," said Carlyle, "by the way he treats little men."

Instead of condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try to figure out why they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism, and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness.

> "Don't be afraid of the enemies who attack you. Be affraid of the friends who flatter you." - General Alvaro Obregon

We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem? We provide them with roast beef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect to give them kind words of appreciation that would sing in their memories for years like the music of the morning stars.

## He Who Can Do This Has The Whole World With Him

The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

> "Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire, and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way." - Harry A. Overstreet

Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself:

> "How can I make this person want to do it?"

Always frame a situation around what's in it for them. Such as getting a kindergartener excited about their first day and what they will get out of it; finger painting, new friends, etc.

> "If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.” - Henry Ford

The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. , a noted lawyer and

> “People who can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.” - Owen D. Young (one of America’s great business leaders)

When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own;
they will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.
