A place to document how AI-powered tools can be used to assist the development of software. To increase its chances of ensuring time, I'll focus on age old approaches that have worked for decades: thinking and planning, good source control discipline, testing, linting code quality, etc.

### Subagents

[Subagents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) are specialized AI assistants in Claude Code that focus on specific domains of software engineering. They provide expert-level guidance, automate complex tasks, and coordinate with other agents to deliver comprehensive solutions.

Importantly each subagent operates in its own context, preventing pollution of the main conversation, helping to keep it focused on high-level objectives.
