A place to document how I use AI to assist the development of software. To increase its chances of enduring time, I'll focus on age old approaches that have worked for decades: thinking and planning, good source control discipline, testing, linting code quality, etc.

- [Repomix](https://repomix.com/): Packages your entire codebase into a single AI-friendly file `repomix-output.xml`
- [vibe-rules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vibe-rules) CLI tool for managing and sharing AI rules (prompts, configurations) across different editors and tools
- [Extended Thinking Mode (Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/visible-extended-thinking) - Documentation on Claude's thinking capabilities

### Subagents

[Subagents](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) are specialized AI assistants in Claude Code that focus on specific domains of software engineering. They provide expert-level guidance, automate complex tasks, and coordinate with other agents to deliver comprehensive solutions.

Importantly each subagent operates in its own context, preventing pollution of the main conversation, helping to keep it focused on high-level objectives.

## vibe-rules

Much of the web dev eco-system provides great LLM context support. Such as TanStack Router using [vibe-rules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vibe-rules).

In the evolving AI landscape, prompts and context are becoming increasingly crucial components of development workflows. Just like code libraries, reusable AI rules and prompts are emerging as shareable assets.

We anticipate more NPM packages will begin exporting standardized AI configurations, often via a `llms` entry point (e.g., `my-package/llms`). vibe-rules embraces this trend with the install command.

```
npm i -g vibe-rules
vibe-rules install claude-code
```

vibe-rules cheat sheet:

```sh
# Save from a file (e.g., .mdc, .md, or plain text)
vibe-rules save my-rule-name -f ./path/to/rule-content.md

# See all the rules you've saved to the common local store
vibe-rules list

# Load 'my-rule-name' for Claude Code IDE globally (updates ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
vibe-rules load my-rule-name claude-code --global
# Alias: vibe-rules add my-rule-name claude-code -g


# Most common: Install rules from ALL dependencies/devDependencies for claude-code
# Scans package.json, finds packages with 'llms' export, applies rules.
vibe-rules install claude-code

# Install rules from a specific package for claude-code
# (Assumes 'my-rule-package' is in node_modules)
vibe-rules install claude-code my-rule-package

# Install rules from a specific package into a custom target dir for Roo/Cline
vibe-rules install roo my-rule-package -t ./custom-ruleset/

# Install rules into the project's unified .rules file
vibe-rules install unified my-awesome-prompts
```

Several editors are supported, here's how claude code integration works:

- Appends/updates rules within XML-like tagged blocks in a `<!-- vibe-rules Integration -->` section in `./CLAUDE.md` (local) or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global).
- Each rule is encapsulated in tags like `<rule-name>...</rule-name>` within the single markdown file.
- Supports metadata formatting for `alwaysApply` and `globs` configurations.
