## Make essentials

`make` generates files from other files, using _recipes_, the syntax is as follows. Please note, thanks to POSIX standardisation the recipe MUST be indented with a tab (not spaces):

```
target_file: prerequisite_file1 prerequisite_file2
	shell command to build target_file (MUST be indented with tabs, not spaces)
	another shell command (these commands are called the "recipe")
```

Unless you specify otherwise, Make assumes that the target (`target_file` above) and prerequisites (`prerequisite_file1` and `prerequisite_file2`) are actual files or directories. You can ask Make to build a target from the command line like this:

```bash
$ make target_file
```

If the `target_file` does not exist, or if `prerequisite_file1` or `prerequisite_file2` have been modified since `target_file` was last built, Make will run the given shell commands. But first Make will check to see if there are recipes in the Makefile for `prerequisite_file1` and `prerequisite_file2` and build or rebuild those if necessary.

An example of this in action:

```
P=seething
OBJECTS= main.o safe_sum.o

all: $(P)

$(P): $(OBJECTS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(P) $(OBJECTS) $(LDLIBS)
```

The first target, in this case `all` is the default target, and is dependent on my project `seething`. In order to build the binary `seething`, make moves on looking for the `seething` target, which is dependent on objects `main.o` and `safe_sum.o`. The recipe defines instructions make should use to invoke the C compiler, which will produce an output binary of `seething`. Luckily we don't have to explain to make how to build `main.o` and `safe_sum.o`, because make is smart enough to infer a default build recipe, because we are dealing with C, will be `$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $*.c`, concretely for `safe_sum.o` this will wind up being `gcc -Wall -g -std=gnu11 -O0 -Iinclude -o safe_sum.o safe_sum.c`

### Equal signs

About the equal signs:

`:=` simple shallow evaluation
`=` recursively expands defined variables

```makefile
A := Did $(C)
B = Did $(C)
C  = you understand?

all:
    $(info $(A)) # output "Did"
    $(info $(B)) # output "Did you understand?"
```

### Built-in variables

- `$@` current target
- `$<` name of the first prerequisite
- `$^` all prerequisites
- `$*` target with no suffix (e.g. `prog.o`, `$*` is just `prog`)
- `$(@D)` directory part of the file name of the target
- `$(@F)` file part of the file name of the target

### Phony targets

A phony target prevents make from confusing it with a real file. For example, with `.PHONY`, even if a file called 'clean' is actually created, `make clean` will still execute.

    .PHONY: clean
    clean:
      rm -f $(P)
      rm -f *.o
      rm -f *.log

**Utility functions**

make provides a treasure trove of handy [utility functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Functions) for common tasks such as transforming text. Below uses `filter-out` to strip out a couple of CFLAG options:

    the_day=$(shell date +%A)

    .PHONY: stringfun
    stringfun:
      $(info $(filter-out -Wall -g -O0,$(CFLAGS)))
      $(info Ben it's $(the_day)!)

Running this:

    [ben@think]$ make stringfun
    -std=gnu11 -Iinclude -Iinclude/engine `pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0`
    Ben it's Sunday!
    make: Nothing to be done for 'stringfun'.

**Other bits**

`make -p` will dump out implicit rules and variables available

## C specifics

### Custom variables

```makefile
P=seething
OBJECTS= main.o safe_sum.o
the_day=$(shell date +%A)
```

### Implicit variables

`make` is a generic system for generating files, based on other files. It is in no way, specific to a C compiler, and can be used to drive any compiler. Make is a great platform for driving common tasks, such as producing documentation, or running a test suite. To ease working with common languages and compilers, make does have a general awareness, for example, of how to (agnostically) drive a C compiler. If it detects its working with a C, standard (or implicit) variables such as `CC` (name of desired C compiler), `CFLAGS` (compiler flags), `LDFLAGS` (linker flags) kick in. See [implicit variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Variables) for more.

Program for compiling C programs

```makefile
CC=gcc  # CC = C compiler to use
CFLAGS= -Wall -g -std=gnu11 -O3 -Iinclude -Iinclude/engine  # flags to pass to C compiler
```

If you're not familiar with GCC:

- `-Wall` adds compiler warnings
- `-g` adds symbols for debugging
- `-std=gnu11` compiler should allow code conforming to the C11 and POSIX standards
- `-O3` set optimization level three, which applies every clever trick to make your code as fast as possible
- `-I` include paths

While in `CFLAGS` territory, its important to make note of `pkg-config`:

> pkg-config - Return metainformation about installed libraries

Hard coding include paths to third party dependencies works, however it is likely to become a maintenance burden in the future, worse if there are plans to share this `Makefile` with other developers, it is unlikely to work on their system (i.e. poor portability). For example, my project requires the GNOME core utility library [GLib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/). I could append the hardcoded path to my `CFLAG` like this:

```
CFLAGS+= -I/usr/include/glib-2.0
```

However, a slightly better approach is to shell out to `pkg-config` which will return the neatly formatted `-I`, using paths based on my machines installation paths. For example:

```
CFLAGS+= `pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0`
```

Linker flags `LDFLAGS` for everything non-library related (e.g. `-L`).

- `-L` (e.g. `-L/usr/local/lib`) is where to search for libraries to resolve symbols

Libraries that the linker (`ld`) needs to, link in.

```
LDLIBS=
LDFLAGS+= -lglib-2.0 # hard-coded version
```

Again, `pkg-config` can do linker flags, for more robust Makefiles like this:

```
LDLIBS+= `pkg-config --libs glib-2.0 gobject-2.0 gio-2.0`
```

`LDADD` (ADDitional linker/ld) is useful for feeding any other additional terms to the linker, for example `LDADD= -Llibpath -Wl,-Rlibpath`:

- `-L` flag tells the compiler where to search for libraries to resolve symbols
- `-Wl` flag passes its flags through from gcc to the linker
- `-R` the linker will embed these into the runtime search path for libraries to link to

`VPATH` specifies a list of directories that make should search:

    VPATH=src:include:src/engine:include/engine

## Example Makefiles

###

```makefile
# Makefile for transpiling with Babel in a Node app, or in a client- or
# server-side shared library.

.PHONY: all clean

# Install `babel-cli` in a project to get the transpiler.
babel := node_modules/.bin/babel

# Identify modules to be transpiled by recursively searching the `src/`
# directory.
src_files := $(shell find src/ -name '*.js')

# Building will involve copying every `.js` file from `src/` to a corresponding
# file in `lib/` with a `.js.flow` extension. Then we will run `babel` to
# transpile copied files, where the transpiled file will get a `.js` extension.
# This assignment computes the list of transpiled `.js` that we expect to end up;
# and we will work backward from there to figure out how to build them.
transpiled_files := $(patsubst src/%,lib/%,$(src_files))

# Putting each generated file in the same directory with its corresponding
# source file is important when working with Flow: during type-checking Flow
# will look in npm packages for `.js.flow` files to find type definitions. So
# putting `.js` and `.js.flow` files side-by-side is how you export type
# definitions from a shared library.

# Compute the list of type-definition source files that we want to end up with.
# This is done by replacing the `.js` extension from every value in the
# `transpiled_files` list with a `.js.flow` extension.
flow_files := $(patsubst %.js,%.js.flow,$(transpiled_files))

# Ask `make` to build all of the transpiled `.js` and `.js.flow` files that we
# want to end up with in `lib/`.
#
# This target also depends on the `node_modules/` directory, so that `make`
# automatically runs `yarn install` if `package.json` has changed.
all: node_modules $(flow_files) $(transpiled_files)

# This rule tells `make` how to transpile a source file using `babel`.
# Transpiled files will be written to `lib/`
lib/%: src/%
	mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	$(babel) $< --out-file $@ --source-maps

# Transpiling one file at a time makes incremental transpilation faster:
# `make` will only transpile source files that have changed since the last
# invocation.

# This rule tells `make` how to produce a `.js.flow` file. It is just a copy of
# a source file - the rule copies a file from `src/` to `lib/` and changes the
# extension.
lib/%.js.flow: src/%.js
	mkdir -p $(dir $@)
	cp $< $@

clean:
	rm -rf lib

# This rule informs `make` that the `node_modules/` directory is out-of-date
# after changes to `package.json` or `yarn.lock`, and instructs `make` on how to
# install modules to get back up-to-date.
node_modules: package.json yarn.lock
	yarn install
```

This tiny `Makefile` showcases many of the useful features of make, such as variables, implicit variables, recipes, path probing with vpath, automatic make variables (e.g. `$<`, `$@`, `$*`), phony targets and utility functions. [RTFM](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) for more.
