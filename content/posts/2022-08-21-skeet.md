## Gems

- The [Mongolian Vowel Separator](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/180e/index.htm) (U+180E) has had an interesting life. It was introduced in Unicode 3.0.0, when it was in the Cf category (other, formatting). Then in Unicode 4.0.0 it was moved into the Zs (separator, space) category. In Unicode 6.3.0 it was then moved back to the Cf category.
