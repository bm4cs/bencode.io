Now my post-grad studies are finalised ive got some spare time to inject into technology. I plan to inject some solid hours into running through the .NET 3.0 certification stream.

Some areas that currently excite me, which I hope to spend more time with:

- ASP.NET MVC
- Advanced Windows Debugging
- Azure/Oslo/Dublin
- BizTalk Server 2009
- Claims Security and BizTalk
- JQuery
- JSON/POX WCF EndPoints
- MsBuild
- NServiceBus
- OpenId
- PKI and BizTalk
- PowerShell
- SharePoint Services
- UDP Multicast based Pub/Sub Engine
- Workflow Foundation
