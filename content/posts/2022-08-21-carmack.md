[John Carmack](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack) is my hero. If it weren't for John, his insane talent as a computer programmer and his ground breaking innovations at Id Software, its highly probable I would have been set on a very different trajectory in life. Computers gripped me hard as an adolescent and I've never looked back. Today I'm software engineer that gets paid to do what I love.

## Ethic

John's ground breaking achievements is an existance proof that hard work and deep focus are the only real ingredients that produce profoundly impactful results.

- Invest in what you do and work hard. Minimum 60 hours a week.
- Minimise distractions and guard focus. Don't say yes to everything.

## Books

He is an avid reader. Recently posted some of his [scifi collection](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1525527916431515651)

## Plan files

At Id he famously organised his work using [plan files](https://garbagecollected.org/2017/10/24/the-carmack-plan/) which were made available using the [finger protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol)

> As life in the war room pressed on, Carmack took it upon himself to let gamers know that, yes, id really was moving along with its work on Quake. So he decided to upload his daily work log, or, as it was known, a .plan file, to the Internet. Plan files were often used by programmers to keep each other informed of their efforts but had yet to be exploited as means of communicating with the masses. But id’s fans had suffered months, years, of Romero’s unsubstantiated hyperbole, Carmack felt and it was time that they saw some hard data.

Plan:

This is my daily work ...

When I accomplish something, I write a * line that day.

Whenever a bug / missing feature is mentioned during the day and
I don’t fix it, I make a note of it. Some things get noted many times
before they get fixed.

Occasionally I go back through the old notes and mark with a +
the things I have since fixed.
