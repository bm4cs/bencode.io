## Introduction

- Lean and agile
- Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
- Agile Release Train
- 4 configurations; full, large solution, ...
- Lean thinking; specify value by product, ...
- Integrates agile; individual over processes, working software over (manifesto)
- Seven core competencies of business agility

The house of Lean.

Value overarches everything:

- respect for people and culture
- flow; incremental delivery, evidence based, built in quality, reducing batch sizes
- innovation; provide time and space for innovation, pivot without mergy or guilt
- relentless improvement; problem-solving culture, based improvement on facts (not assumptions)

Leadership underpins everything.

- Cannot be delegated
- Adopt a growth mindset
- Development people
- Lead the change
- Agile focused on the team (not the leadership).

### Visualise and limit WIP

- Little's law the seminal law of queuing theory
- Small batch sizes

## High performing teams

- equal access to information is crucial
- break down silos
- Building your team; name, purpose, skills

## Scrum master and Product Owner

- PO creates PBIs, stories, prioritises the backlog, maximises value within the team, significant resposibility outside of the delivery team working with stakeholders the customer
- SM coaches teh agile team, enforces the scrum process, helps coordinate teams, helps operates under

# Agile RElease Trains

- Virtual organisation of 5 - 12 teams
- Aligned to common mission via a single program backlog

ART roles:

- Release train engineer, acts as chief scrum master for train
- System architect, technical authority and product owner collaboration
- Business owners, key stakeholders
- System team, processes and tools to integrate assets early and often
- Product management, defines and prioritises the program backlog

How:

- Portfolio backlog, epics
- Program backlog, features
- Team backlog, stories

Defining features:

- Benefit hypothesis
- Short phrases in the voice of the customer
- Clearly express value
- Small vertical slices of functionality

Team backlog:

- Priotised by product owner
- Contains user and enabler stories
- TODO: more tips

Acceptance criteria:

- TODO

User stories:

- Short descriptions of small pieces of desired functionality, written in the users language
- _As a <user>, I want to <activity> so that <outcome>_
- Personas consider fictional characters acting as a representative user (e.g. mileage sensitive car user vs a time sensitive car user)

How to write good stories and PBIs, INVEST!

- Independent
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimable
- Small
- Testable

The 3Cs from XP:

- Card, capture users intent
- Conversation, details are in the conversation with the product owner
- Confirmation, acceptance criteria confirm the story correctness

Enabler stories:

These build the groundwork for future user stories. Proactive.

- Infrastructure
- TODO

Splitting stories:

- In support small batch size, lean philosophy.
- Splitting techniques; TODO

## Behavior driven Development

- Specific examples of behavior to reduce ambiguity
- Given-When-Then format works well, as an acceptance criteria format.

Sequencing stories:

- Product owner based on prioritises
- Capacity allocations for defects, maintenance and refactors
- Dependencies with other stories, teams, milestones

Iteration planning:

- Purpose
- Process, PO defines the what, team defines the how, 4 hours max
  - Capacity, leave, availability, ops tasks, meetings
  - Story analysis
  - Detailing stories
  - Developing iteration goals
- Result, iteration goals
- Reciprical

Story points:

- A singular number that represents; volume, complexity, knowledge and uncertainty
- They are relative
- Need to know your teams "one"
- Don't go beyond 8 points per story
- For every full time dev and tester, allocate 8 points per person
- Subtract 1 for every member on a vacation day
- Find a small story that would take 0.5 a day to develop, and 0.5 to test, call it a 1
- Estimated capacity =
- Deduct stories from available capacity

Estimating poker:

- Combines expert opinion, analohy, disaggregation for quick but reliable estimates

1. Each estimator gets a deck of cards
2. Read a job
3. Esimators privately select cards
4. Cards are turned over
5. Discuss differences
6. Re-estimate

Iteration goals:

- Provide goals provide clarity, commitment and management of information;
- Align to common purpose
- Provide transparency and management information
