Over the last year I have been experimenting with reducing the weight of my hiking pack when out on track.

Reading [books](https://www.amazon.com.au/Ultralight-Backpackin-Tips-Mike-Clelland/dp/0762763841) on ultralight hiking, has me with some strategies for doing so.

# Stacked packing system

Maximising the space in a 35L is essential. Using the _stacking method_, I discovered on the amazing [Darwin Hikes - 35L how to pack walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yt31hDdEuk), is a modular system, that involves stacking components up in a specific sequence.

Some benefits:

- Dry things stay down the bottom.
- Easy access to rain jacket, food and tent.
- The food bag is often the heaviest item. Locating it in the centre of the pack, keeps the pack squared securely on your back.

## Inner pack

1. Sleeping pad folded up against the back of the pack (great for providing some structure to frameless packs)
2. A bag liner (garbage bag is best)
3. Quilt
4. Clothing
5. Puffer jacket - at this point seal the bag liner off
6. Food bag
7. Tent
8. Rain jacket

## Side pockets

1. 1L water bottle on bother side (to balance the pack out)
2. Cold soak container
3. Snacks
4. Water filter

## Front pocket

1. Tent stakes
2. Trowel and toilet paper.
3. Ditty bag.
4. Empty 1L platypus bladder.

# Options

These mostly come down to weight trade-offs:

- Depending on weather forecast, consider taking out a freestanding tent.
- Don't bother with hiking boots, trail runners are king
- In colder seasons don't scrimp on warm gear to save grams
  - booties
  - heavy quilt
  - high R value sleeping pad
  - gloves
- A 1L nalgene bottle is great as a hot water bottle
- Cook system is optional (see _cold soaking_ below)
- Try a single hiking pole

# Ditty bag

All the utilities, bits and pieces.

- Toothpaste tablets (repackaged)
- Toothbrush
- Baby wipes (repackaged)
- Hydralite
- Band-aids
- Deoderant (repackaged)
- Mini swiss army knife
- Chapstick
- Shower gel (repackaged)
- Mosquito repellant (repackaged)
- Earbuds
- Sunscreen (repackaged)
- Water treatment tablets
- Telfast
- Patch repair kit for sleeping pad
- Needle + thread
- Feet tape

# Food

Things that have worked for me, over trial and error:

- Plan for at least 700 grams of food per day.
- At least 3L of water per day.
- Drink as much water as possible directly from water sources, using the Katadyn BeFree or Sawyer Squeeze.

## Cold soak meal recipes

A method for rehydrating meals using just cold water, over a couple of hours. The plus side, no need to bring a cook system, and they optionally work great with boiling water.

### Refried beans

- Dehdrated refried beans (or Quinoa)
- Seasoning
- Corn chips
- Olive oil

### Pinto beans

- Curry powder
- Sun dried tomatoes
- Tuna packet

### Veggies

### Oil wrap

- Almond butter
- Dried fruits
- Tortilla

### Potato Bomb

- Powdered potatoes

# Lessons learned

## April 2021

- always use R value mat for cold earth
- heavier sleeping bag
- dromlite not great, take more bottles instead
- more training, to lessen leg pain
- look into getting done 1L platapus bladders
- fast flow chunk filter, carbon disks?
- stove, hot water is too good in the cold
- coffee, miso soup, noodles
- more hydralite
- befree how to clean, it blocked up badly
- get some lightweight fishing gear
- feet tape essential with trail runners
- normal woolen socks next time, not the injinji toe socks
- ditch the poo shovel
- bring fire lighting kit
- convertible pants
- warmer sleep system will reduce clothing weight
- one nalgene bottle, for hot water bottle
- 700g of food per day next trip

## November 2021

- pivot to a free standing tent when weather is poor
- fix thermarest neoair xlite air mattress leak
- aluminium foil wind shield for stove
- velcro pillow to air mattress
- experiment with potato bomb
- make coffee tea bags
- experiment making damper from raw flour
- use normal sunscreen (the sticks suck)
- small usb micro charger for bindi head lamp
- gossamer gear "the two" is terrible in heavy rain and strong wind
- didn't use list:
  - thermal top
  - water proof socks
- things that worked well:
  - trail runners in the rain
  - only needed one pair of socks
  - running shorts performed well in the wet drying quickly while walking
- things that didn't work well:
  - mont gortex jacket way too heavy
  - mont zero jacket too light and cold
  - gossamer gear the two tent was windy and wet inside and sand pegs kept blowing out
  - thermarest neoair xlite had a slow leak
  - lightweight stove setup used up all gas within 3 days due to lack of wind shield
  - loose blister tape gave me a blister on left heal
