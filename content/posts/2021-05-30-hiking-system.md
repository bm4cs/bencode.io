Over the last year I have been experimenting with reducing the weight of my hiking pack when out on track.

Reading [books](https://www.amazon.com.au/Ultralight-Backpackin-Tips-Mike-Clelland/dp/0762763841) on ultralight hiking, has left me with some great strategies for doing so.

As a result has made hiking more enjoyable for me. Not only do I have more energy, I can walk further, my body doesn't feel broken at the end of a big day, meaning I can just enjoy the journey that much more.

# Stacked packing system

This stacking method, I discovered on the amazing [Darwin Hikes - 35L how to pack walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yt31hDdEuk), is a modular system, that involves stacking components up in a specific sequence.

Some benefits:

-   Dry things stay down the bottom.
-   Easy access to rain jacket, food and tent.
-   The food bag is often the heaviest item. Locating it in the centre of the pack, keeps the pack squared securely on your back.

## Inner pack

1. Sleeping pad folded up against the back of the pack (great for providing some structure to frameless packs)
2. A bag liner (garbage bag is best)
3. Quilt
4. Clothing
5. Puffer jacket - at this point seal the bag liner off
6. Food bag
7. Tent
8. Rain jacket

## Outer

Using a 35L pack, its essential to maximise the outer pockets.

### Side pockets

1. 1L water bottle on bother side (to balance the pack out)
2. Cold soak container
3. Snacks
4. Water filter

### Front pocket

1. Tent stakes
2. Trowel and toilet paper.
3. Ditty bag.
4. Empty 1L platypus bladder.

# Cold soak meals

A method for rehydrating meals using just cold water, over a couple of hours. The plus side, not having to carry out a cook system (i.e. weight savings).
