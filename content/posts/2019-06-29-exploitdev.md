A fundamental primer on exploit development on both Windows and Linux based OS's.

The classical classes of vulnerablilities:

* buffer overflow
* stack overflow
* heap overflow
* use after free
* out of bounds read


# Integer Overflow and NetBSD

Considered concrete [example](http://blog.infosectcbr.com.au/2018/01/netbsd-kernel-wscons-ioctl-vulnerable.html) in the NetBSD kernel, based on an incorrect coding style that is exposed to integer overflow during input validation.

    static int
    set_cursor(struct tfb_softc *sc, struct wsdisplay_cursor *p)
    {
    #define cc (&sc->sc_cursor)
            u_int v, index = 0, count = 0, icount = 0;
            uint8_t r[2], g[2], b[2], image[512], mask[512];
            int error, s;
    
            v = p->which;
            if (v & WSDISPLAY_CURSOR_DOCMAP) {
                    index = p->cmap.index;
                    count = p->cmap.count;
                    if (index >= 2 || (index + count) > 2)
    +++ integer overflow
                            return (EINVAL);
                    error = copyin(p->cmap.red, &r[index], count);
                    if (error)
                            return error;
                    error = copyin(p->cmap.green, &g[index], count);
                    if (error)
                            return error;
                    error = copyin(p->cmap.blue, &b[index], count);
                    if (error)
                            return error;

Note the overflow, about 1/2 way down. Just imagine if `index` was a really large value that overflowed 32 bits. A more robust way to code the validation check, can be seen in the OpenBSD code:

    if (index >= 256 || count > 256 - index)
        return (EINVAL);

While a bit strange at first glance, is rather elegant. If `index` is big, it bails. If `index` is big it also bails.


# Static Analysis with Clang

Is the process of doing analysis of the program using techniques like data flow analysis, point-to analysis, common mis-uses of API's, taint analysis and more. Clang, the LLVM compiler frontend for C/C++, has an incredible static analyzer, and can be invoked when kicking off `make`, like so:

    scan-build make

TODO: run sample, and review HTML report.


# Fuzzing

> Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a testing technique used to discover bugs in all types of software. It involves inputting massive amounts of random data, called fuzz, to the test subject in an attempt to make it crash.

Common types:

* **Dumb** fuzz just randomly mutate input data, and measure crashes.
* **Generative** fuzzing domain specific knowledge of target protocol or format (e.g. SSH handshake or PDF headers), fuzz specific fields (negative, max, all 9's, ...) and combinations of them together in the protocol, measuring crashes along the way.
* **Grammar based** fuzzing involves building up a context-free grammar (CFG) using the Sequitur (or Nevill-Manning algorithm), based on test cases of a programs input. This could be an ELF binary representation made by `readelf` for example.
* **Smart** fuzzing uses symbolic execution, to guide the control flow through a program intelligently so that all possible branches and permutations are exercised. This gives the fuzzer the ability to measure code coverage at runtime, and to focus in on certain branches that are less exposed.
* **Instrumented** fuzzing places probes into the target binary through custom compilation. Using probe measurements allow for guided branch execution. Very effective in practice. The [american fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) or `afl` takes this approach, and in practice can almost guarentee crash a program that has never been fuzzed.


To take `afl` for a spin, first install, on my archlinux box a quick `pacman -Sy afl-utils afl` did the job. The `afl-gcc` GCC wrapper instruments the produced binary and can optionally add a number of protection mechanisms such as *stack cookies* and *source fortification*. The actually fuzz workload is done with `afl-fuzz`, which given a seed file, brute fuzzes a variety of inputs. Take the following program:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    int
    main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
            char q[20];
            char s[1000];
    
            fgets(s, sizeof(s), stdin);
            printf("%s\n", s);
            if (s[0] == 'c') {
                    strcpy(q, &s[1]);
                    printf("%s\n", q);
            }
    }

Hmm there's a buffer overflow vulnerability, only if a certain branch of logic is exercised. Let's see if `afl` can find it. First compile:

    $ afl-gcc buggy.c -o buggy -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-strong
    afl-cc 2.52b by <lcamtuf@google.com>
    [+] Instrumented 5 locations (64-bit, non-hardened mode, ratio 100%).

Now we have an instrumented binary, its fuzz time. `afl` works best with a seed file/s, it will use this as a basis to get up and running, and build upon it:

    $ mkdir in && echo "123" > in/fuzztest_input
	$ afl-fuzz -i in -o out ./buggy

`afl` will throw thousands of variations of input at the target binary:

                            american fuzzy lop 2.52b (buggy)

In the output dir:

We can see at least one crash has been detected:

    # cat crashes/id\:000000\,sig\:06\,src\:000001\,op\:havoc\,rep\:16
    c��������p��������
                      ��������p�

It starts with a `c` character, which we can see from the source code, gets into the branch of execution where the buffer overflow vuln lives. Then the other random 20+ bytes worth of data blow out the 20-byte buffer. The actual bytes themselves dont matter, and the output is better viewed with a hex viewer like `xxd`:

    # xxd -b crashes/id\:000000\,sig\:06\,src\:000001\,op\:havoc\,rep\:16
    00000000: 01100011 11110000 11110000 11110000 11100001 11110000  c.....
    00000006: 11110000 00010000 11110000 11011101 01110000 11110000  ....p.
    0000000c: 00000111 11110001 11110000 11110000 11110000 11110000  ......

    00000018: 11110000 11110000 11110000 11110000 11011100 01110000  .....p
    0000001e: 11110000                                               .

Running the target program with this input, should crash it:

    # ./buggy < ./out/crashes/id\:000000\,sig\:06\,src\:000001\,op\:havoc\,rep\:16
    c��������p��������
                      ��������p�
    *** buffer overflow detected ***: ./buggy terminated
    Aborted

Nice!



# x86 

Given a CPU architecture of your liking, from which there are many (e.g. MIPS, ARM, PowerPC, x64, etc), the key thing to remember is that they are all bounded by the laws of *Turing*, and more specifically the *Von Neumann architecture*. These first principles (e.g. instructions are obtained from memory or in otherwords *software*, hierarchy of memories and registers, an ALU for arithmetic based on binary representations, an instruction pointer that defines the instruction to be executed and so on) underpin all modern computing that takes place. If you like to go deeper, you can't go past the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) 12 week program, in which you design and build a simple but fully featured 16-bit microprocessor literally starting from NAND gates.

Given this power, it is essential we work at the chip level using assembly. Higher level abstractions and constructs simply muddy the waters, not giving the fine grained instruction level control required. In other words, grab the assembly manual for the architecture of chip you plan to work with.


## Assembly

Lots of resources out there, but these one pagers keep it simple:

* [NASM Intel x86 Assembly Language Cheat Sheet](/blob/nasmcheatsheet.pdf)
* [Intel Code Table](/blob/intel_code_table.pdf) is a consise one page on the transfer, arithmetic, logic, jumps and misc instructions provided by the 80186 instruction set and higher.
* [GCC x86 Assembly Quick Reference](/blob/att_x86.pdf) is another, but shows off the AT&T style assembly sytnax, which `gdb` uses. 



## Reverse string in EBX

    endcount:

    	mov cl,[eax]

# Debugging with GDB

The GNU debugger, the gold standard when it comes to debugging on Linux. Make sure the [peda extension](https://github.com/longld/peda) is installed, which add some insanely useful feature to GDB, like better colorisation and visual (still CLI!) display of memory and instructions, and commands like `context`, `context_stack` and `jmpall` to name but a few.

    git clone https://github.com/longld/peda.git ~/peda
    echo "source ~/peda/peda.py" >> ~/.gdbinit

Don't forget `help peda` has always got your back.


## GDB Cheatsheet

`break foo` set breakpoint of function `foo`
`break *0xf7cd6ef8` set breakpoint on specific instruction
`break main:66`
`x/i foo` to examine each instruction of `foo`
`r` run program (once all breaks in place)
`c` continue
`stepi` step next instruction
`nexti` 

`info reg` dump out all registers
`x/s $esp` print `esp` as string
`print "%d\n", 0xf7cd6edc` printf style output of memory or registers
