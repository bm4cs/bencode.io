## CKA topics

1. Cluster Architecture, Installation & Configuration: How to set up and configure a Kubernetes cluster, including how to install and configure a Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm`, how to upgrade your cluster version, how to backup and restore an `etcd` cluster, and how to configure a pod to use secrets
2. Workloads & Scheduling: How to deploy a Kubernetes application, create daemonsets, scale the application, configure health checks, use multi-container pods, and use config maps and secrets in a pod. You'll also need to know how to expose your application using services
3. Services & Networking: How to expose applications within the cluster or outside the cluster, how to manage networking policies, and how to configure ingress controllers
4. Storage: How to create and configure persistent volumes, how to create and configure persistent volume claims, and how to expand persistent volumes
5. Troubleshooting: How to troubleshoot common issues in a Kubernetes environment, including how to diagnose and resolve issues with pods, nodes, and network traffic

## Kubernetes in a nutshell

**Control plane** management components that mother-hen nodes and pods. Key components:

- **API server**: the frontend API that ties everything together (port 6443)
- **Scheduler**: determines which _nodes_ to run _pods_ on
- **etcd**: distributed key-value store used as backing store for all cluster meta-data (ports 2379 and 2380)

**Node** a worker machine (VM) that hosts _pods_:

- **Kubelet**: agent used by control plane components to manage and monitor nodes, exposes an httpd api to provide metrics about the node (port 10250). A read-only api is also provided on 10255. 
- **Kube Proxy**: manages network rules to enable communication between pods and external entities (port 10256)
- **supervisord**: monitoring of the kubelet and pods
- **Container Network Interface (CNI)**: a software defined network (SDN) plugin such as calico, flannel or weave.
- **fluentd**: unified logging agent
- **containerd**: a container runtime of some sort

**Pod** a set of containers (spacesuit)

**ReplicaSet** manages replicas of a _pod_ (ex: 3 nginx pods)

**Deployment** transitions actual state to desired state

**Service** exposes an application that may be running on many pods, externally from the k8s cluster

## Lab environment

A minimal 3 VM setup, all running ubuntu 22.04 servers, each with 2 vCPUs, 2 GB RAM and 32 GB disk (these requirements will be validated by `kubeadm init` pre-flight checks)

1. `cka-control` on `192.168.1.20`
2. `cka-worker1` on `192.168.1.21`
3. `cka-worker2` on `192.168.1.22`

Setting up the cluster play-by-play:

1. `git clone git@github.com:bm4cs/cka.git`
2. Install CRI-O: `sudo ~/cka/setup-container.sh`
3. Install kubetools: `sudo ~/cka/setup-kubetools.sh`
4. On the control node, setup cluster: `sudo kubeadm init` (see example output for my cluster below)
5. Setup `kubectl` client:
   - `mkdir ~/.kube`
   - `sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf ~/.kube/config`
   - `sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) .kube/config`
6. Setup a network [plugin](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/) - [Calico](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/getting-started/kubernetes/self-managed-onprem/onpremises) in this case
   - Install calico operator: `kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.27.0/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml`
   - Install calico custom resource defintions: `kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.27.0/manifests/custom-resources.yaml`
   - Confirm calico pods are running: `watch kubectl get pods -n calico-system`
7. Join nodes to the cluster with `sudo kubeadm join <JOIN-TOKEN>`

#### kubeadm init sample output

```
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Alternatively, if you are the root user, you can run:

export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 192.168.1.20:6443 --token b92xdr.6kv3hmbvkql7jm5p \
  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:716f8aa49972954896bb9b128eee16c8585bd8b10e37ac05e296fc27eb1c0e00
```

## Cluster Build-out

### Networking

Kubernetes primatives need to communicate internally and with the outside world:

- Node: physical network
- External to service: kubernetes service resources
- Pod to service: kubernetes services
- Pod to pod: kubernetes CNI network plugin
- Container to container: pod

Kubernetes uses Container Network Interface (CNI) [plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/) for cluster networking. Out of the box is not opinionates about specific plugins to use, instead it simply provides the CNI interface and lets you choose:

- Calico: Calico is a powerful networking and network security solution for containers, virtual machines, and native host-based workloads. It provides both networking and network policy enforcement, and it works with a broad range of platforms including Kubernetes, Docker, and OpenStack
- Flannel: Flannel is a simple and easy-to-use CNI plugin that satisfies Kubernetes requirements. It creates a virtual network among the various nodes in a Kubernetes cluster, providing a subnet to each node from which pods can be assigned IP addresses
- Weave Net: Weave Net creates a virtual network that connects Docker containers deployed across multiple hosts. It uses a simple, encrypted peer-to-peer communication protocol to establish a routed network between the containers, allowing them to discover each other and communicate securely
- Cilium: Cilium leverages eBPF technology to provide networking and security for microservices in Kubernetes. It provides network visibility, load balancing, and network policy enforcement
- Hybridnet: Designed for hybrid clouds, it provides both overlay and underlay networking for containers in one or more clusters
