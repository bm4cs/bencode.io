Based on the high quality _build your own CPU_ guide by [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/8bit). Ben cites the SAP-1 CPU architecture as the design inspiration for the CPU, which originated from the book [Digital Computer Electonics](https://www.amazon.com.au/Digital-Computer-Electronics-Albert-Malvino/dp/0028005945) by Albert Paul Malvino.

> The SAP (Simple As Possible) computer has been designed for you, the beginner. Its purpose, to introduce the crucial ideas behind a CPUs operation without burying you in unnecessary detail.

## Dirty power

Using an oscilloscope will observe the transition from low to high is rather dirty. To overcome this, the data sheet recommends dropping in a 0.01uF capacitor between pin 5 and ground. In addition placing a 0.1uF capacitor across the positve and negative power pins. When the transistors state change, they immediately attempt to pull in as much current as they can to drive from low to high. At the nano second scale on the oscilloscope, can see this results in a slight lag in pulling the needed current, and also results in a voltage spike/overshoot. To feed this state transition with the needed current, filling up a capacitor (in this case, a 0.1uF across positve and negative pins) will provide an immediate pool of current for use, resulting in a faster low to high, and consequently less of an overshoot/spike.

# General Electonics

## Resistors

Measured in ohms. Resistors commonly come in 4 and 5 band variations. A 4 band simply skips out of the 3rd significant digit.

1. 1st significant digit
1. 2nd significant digit
1. 3rd significant digit
1. multiplier
1. tolerance

## Capacitors

Measured in pico farads.

Ceramic caps, due to tiny print real-estate use a 3 digit numeric code, such as 104. A 1st and 2nd significant digit, followed by a multiplier. Therefore a 104 = 100,000pF = 100nf = 0.1uF

## D flip flop

Has a single data input D, and a clock input. It will store the input state D, at the time of the rising edge of the clock pulse.

# The clock

2020-07-12

First up to tackle the clock, the backbone of synchronising all digital operations within the CPU. The classic 555 timer IC has been selected, due to its versatility.

The clock will provide an adjustable speed (1Hz upto 200Hz), and a handy debugging _push button manual mode_ to advance a single clock cycle.

The 555 essentially contain a couple of comparators which feed into an SR latch. The first _trigger_ comparator is set to a high voltage of 1.67v, and the second _threshold_ comparator set to a low voltage of 3.33v. When the 3.3v threshold is hit, a discharge transistor is enabled, which drains the capacitor (external to the 555 IC). This capacitor will continually drain and fill, based on this relationship. The drain and fill (duty cycle) rates of the capacitor can be controlled by resistors.

The timing period in seconds can be calculated as **0.693 (Ra + 2Rb) C**

For example a 555 configured with an **Ra** of 1K ohms, **Rb** of 100K ohms, and a 1uF capacitor:

    0.693 (1000 + 2 * 100000) 0.000001
    0.139293 seconds

555 timer modes:

-   _Astable_ generates a constant stream of square waves
-   _Monostable_ provides two states, one stable (push button controlled), and one unstable variable stream of square waves
-   _Bistable_, aka a flip flop, stable in both states, output high and output low

# The registers

2020-08-22

Registers are how a CPU persists data. Registers are cool, because they can store (latch) and/or output their 8-bits of state conditionally, using the _load_ and _enable_ pins.

Given the SAP-1 supports 8-bits, this CPU will feature 3 8-bit registers A, B and IR. The A and B registers are general purpose. The IR, or instruction register, will keep track of the current instruction being executed.

A first attempt at building a register, one might reach for 8 _D flip flops_ to store the state of each input bit.

This will unconditionally store the state. We still need to figre out a way to only conditionally store the input data (from a common bus backbone) only when the _load_ bit is enabled.

![Register load bit logic](/images/8bit-register-dflipflop-load-logic.png)

To prevent all the registers sourcing and sinking their inputs and outputs onto the common 8-bit bus which interconnects them, there needs to be a way to physically disconnect the 8 input pins and/or the 8 output pins to each register.

This is where **tri-state** logic gates come to the rescue. In tri-state logic, a third NULL state is introduced. Outputs can now be high, low or nothing.

The 74LS245 provides 8 tri-state buffers, that can be enabled or disabled with an overall _enable pin_.

![74KS245 octal bus transceiver](/images/8bit-74LS2245-tri-state-buffer.png)

Here Ben presents an interesting decision point. To either keep using discrete logic gates (hardcore purist) or shortcut to using pre-fabed chips such as the 74LS173, which includes four 1-bit (aka 4-bit) D register including tri-state buffered output!

Fantastic, this provides all the primitive building blocks to conditionally source 8-bits of input from the bus, and to conditionally sink 8-bits of output to the bus.

While its doable to build these registers by hand using primitive logic gates, it would take a serious amount of space and chips. I'm going with the shortcut option, which will use 2 of the 74LS173 so we can store 8 individual bits. A nice design option, Ben suggests hardwiring the tri-state output to true, so we can wire up LED's to always visualise the state within each register. As a result, each LED ouput leg now must be wired through a tri-state buffer, and will use the 74LS245 which provides 8 tri-state buffers in a single chip.

Each of the 3 registers (A, B and IC) will occupy a single breadboard.

The API of each register module can be conceptualised as follows.

Inputs:

- RESET: completely resets the state of the d flip flops.
- NOLOAD: when low, will latch the state of the bus
- DISABLE: when low, will output 8-bit register value to bus
- CLOCK: signals that the register should operate
- BUS: the common 8-bit bus

Outputs:

- BUS: the common 8-bit bus

This may seem odd, the bus can act as both an input and an output.
