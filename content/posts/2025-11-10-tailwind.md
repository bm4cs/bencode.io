My collection of tips, tricks and pointers on Tailwind CSS. Kudos to [Steve Kinney](https://stevekinney.com/courses/tailwind) for putting together a great "wat" course, an awesome no fuss, lets rock intro.

## Basics

Tailwind pushes the utility-first concept by embracing modern CSS features including: cascade layers, logical properties, responsive design, CSS grid support, OKLCH P3 colors, container queries, dark mode, and native custom properties.





### Tailwind Core Layers

`@import 'tailwindcss';`

### Tree shaking

Tree shaking is the process of eliminating unused utility classes from the final CSS bundle assembled during the build process. Tailwind provides a vast array of utility classes, and in most projects, only a fraction of these classes are actually used in the HTML markup. Tree shaking ensures that only the styles corresponding to the utility classes present in your project's content files (HTML, JavaScript, or templating files) are included in the production CSS output.

It does this by treating files as plain text (no code parsing) scanning for tokens resembling class names. CSS is then made for recognised utilities. Conceptually Tailwind is regexing over the entire source tree (exluding `.gitignore` files, binary, CSS, lock files, etc) for used utilities, stripping out everything unused.

### Group and Peer Modifiers

`group` and `peer` modifiers are two of Tailwind’s most powerful features for creating interactive components without writing Javascript. They allow you to style elements based on the state of their parent (group) or sibling (peer) elements.

This will animate (transition) a shadow, text colors and slightly grow the button:

```html
<div
  class="group rounded-lg bg-white p-6 shadow-md transition-shadow hover:shadow-xl"
>
  <h3
    class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold transition-colors group-hover:text-blue-600"
  >
    Product Card
  </h3>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 transition-colors group-hover:text-gray-800">
    WPI protein powder.
  </p>
  <button
    class="rounded bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 text-white transition-all group-hover:scale-105 group-hover:bg-blue-600"
  >
    Buy Now
  </button>
</div>
```

This will conditionally show content based on the state of a radio button:

```html
<div class="group rounded-lg border p-4">
  <h3 class="font-semibold">Feedback Survey</h3>

  <div class="mt-4 space-y-2">
    <label class="flex items-center gap-2">
      <input type="radio" name="rating" value="good" class="h-4 w-4" />
      <span class="text-sm">Good</span>
    </label>

    <label class="flex items-center gap-2">
      <input type="radio" name="rating" value="poor" class="h-4 w-4" />
      <span class="text-sm">Poor</span>
    </label>
  </div>

  <div
    class="mt-4 hidden rounded bg-yellow-50 p-3 group-has-[input[value='poor']:checked]:block"
  >
    <label class="block text-sm font-medium">What went wrong?</label>

    <textarea
      class="mt-1 block w-full rounded border-2 border-yellow-300 bg-white px-3 py-2 text-sm focus:border-yellow-500 focus:outline-none"
      rows="2"
    ></textarea>
  </div>
</div>
```
