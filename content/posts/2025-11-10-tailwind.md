## Core Concepts

### Utility Classes

Tailwind pushes the **utility-first** concept by embracing modern CSS features including: cascade layers, logical properties, [responsive design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design), CSS grid support, OKLCH P3 colors, [container queries](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#responsive-breakpoints), [dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode), and native custom properties.

You style things with Tailwind by combining many single-purpose presentational classes (utility classes) directly in your markup:

```html
<div
  class="mx-auto flex flex-row max-w-sm items-center gap-x-4 rounded-xl bg-white p-6 shadow-lg outline outline-black/5 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:shadow-none dark:-outline-offset-1 dark:outline-white/10"
>
  <img class="size-12 shrink-0" src="/img/logo.svg" alt="ChitChat Logo" />
  <div>
    <div class="text-xl font-medium text-black dark:text-white">ChitChat</div>
    <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">You have a new message!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

This packs allot of punch:

- The `display` and `padding` utilities (`flex`, `shrink-0`, and `p-6`) to control the overall layout
- The `max-width` and `margin` utilities (`max-w-sm` and `mx-auto`) to constrain the card width and center it horizontally
- The background-color, border-radius, and box-shadow utilities (`bg-white`, `rounded-xl`, and `shadow-lg`) to style the card's appearance
- The width and height utilities (`size-12`) to set the width and height of the logo image
- The gap utilities (`gap-x-4`) to handle the spacing between the logo and the text
- The font-size, color, and font-weight utilities (`text-xl`, `text-black`, `font-medium`, etc.) to style the card text

### Thinking in Utility Classes

To style an element on states like `hover` or `focus`, prefix any utility with the state you want to target, for example `hover:bg-sky-700`:

These prefixes are called [variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states), they only apply the styles from a utility class when the condition for that variant matches.

There are variants for just about everything:

- Pseudo-classes, like `:hover`, `:focus`, `:first-child`, and `:required`
- Pseudo-elements, like `::before`, `::after`, `::placeholder`, and `::selection`
- Media and feature queries, like responsive breakpoints, dark mode, and prefers-reduced-motion
- Attribute selectors, like `[dir="rtl"]`, `[inert]` and `[open]`
- Child selectors, like `& > *` and `& *`

### Tailwind Core Layers

`@import 'tailwindcss';`

### Tree shaking

Tree shaking is the process of eliminating unused utility classes from the final CSS bundle assembled during the build process. Tailwind provides a vast array of utility classes, and in most projects, only a fraction of these classes are actually used in the HTML markup. Tree shaking ensures that only the styles corresponding to the utility classes present in your project's content files (HTML, JavaScript, or templating files) are included in the production CSS output.

It does this by treating files as plain text (no code parsing) scanning for tokens resembling class names. CSS is then made for recognised utilities. Conceptually Tailwind is regexing over the entire source tree (exluding `.gitignore` files, binary, CSS, lock files, etc) for used utilities, stripping out everything unused. In practice this is done by a rust tool called oxide.

### Group and Peer Modifiers

`group` and `peer` modifiers are two of Tailwind’s most powerful features for creating interactive components without writing Javascript. They allow you to style elements based on the state of their parent (group) or sibling (peer) elements.

This will animate (transition) a shadow, text colors and slightly grow the button:

```html
<div
  class="group rounded-lg bg-white p-6 shadow-md transition-shadow hover:shadow-xl"
>
  <h3
    class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold transition-colors group-hover:text-blue-600"
  >
    Product Card
  </h3>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 transition-colors group-hover:text-gray-800">
    WPI protein powder.
  </p>
  <button
    class="rounded bg-blue-500 px-4 py-2 text-white transition-all group-hover:scale-105 group-hover:bg-blue-600"
  >
    Buy Now
  </button>
</div>
```

This will conditionally show content based on the state of a radio button:

```html
<div class="group rounded-lg border p-4">
  <h3 class="font-semibold">Feedback Survey</h3>

  <div class="mt-4 space-y-2">
    <label class="flex items-center gap-2">
      <input type="radio" name="rating" value="good" class="h-4 w-4" />
      <span class="text-sm">Good</span>
    </label>

    <label class="flex items-center gap-2">
      <input type="radio" name="rating" value="poor" class="h-4 w-4" />
      <span class="text-sm">Poor</span>
    </label>
  </div>

  <div
    class="mt-4 hidden rounded bg-yellow-50 p-3 group-has-[input[value='poor']:checked]:block"
  >
    <label class="block text-sm font-medium">What went wrong?</label>

    <textarea
      class="mt-1 block w-full rounded border-2 border-yellow-300 bg-white px-3 py-2 text-sm focus:border-yellow-500 focus:outline-none"
      rows="2"
    ></textarea>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Container Queries

[Container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries) are a modern CSS feature that let you style something based on the size of a parent element instead of the size of the entire viewport. They let you build components that are a lot more portable and reusable because they can change based on the actual space available for that component.

Use the `@container` class to mark an element as a container, then use variants like `@sm` and `@md` to style child elements based on the size of the container:

```html
<div class="@container">
  <div class="flex flex-col @md:flex-row">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

Just like breakpoint variants, container queries are mobile-first in Tailwind CSS and apply at the target container size and up.


## Flexbox and Grid

### Flexbox

Experiment with [Flexbox Playground](https://tailwind-workshop.vercel.app/playgrounds/flex?boxes=3&height=600&width=w-20)

80% of the time the following 20% features of flexbox are needed:

- `justify-content: <value>;`: Used on the container to define how flex items are distributed along the main axis (usually horizontal). Common values are `center`, `space-between`, and `flex-start`.
- `align-items: <value>;`: Used on the container to define how flex items are aligned along the cross axis (usually vertical). Common values are `center`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, and `stretch`.
- `flex-direction`: row | column;: Used on the container to establish the main axis, defining whether items are laid out horizontally (row, the default) or vertically (column).
- `flex-wrap`: wrap;: Used on the container to allow flex items to wrap onto multiple lines when there isn't enough space on a single line. Essential for responsive design.
- `flex: <shorthand>;`: This is a powerful shorthand property applied to individual flex items, combining `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. It's often set to flex: 1; (which expands to 1 1 0%) to make items equally grow and shrink.
- `flex-grow: <number>;`: Applied to an item, it dictates how much a flex item is allowed to grow relative to the rest of the flex items to fill available free space along the main axis.
- `flex-basis: <length>;`: Applied to an item, it sets the initial size of a flex item before the remaining space is distributed. Often used to set a specific width/height or set to 0 or auto.
- `margin: auto;`: While not a dedicated Flexbox property, using auto margins (e.g., `margin-left: auto;`) on a flex item is an extremely common pattern to push an element to one side or separate it from its siblings along the main axis.
- `order: <number>;`: Applied to an item, it controls the order in which flex items appear in the flex container, regardless of their order in the source HTML. This is particularly useful for mobile-first design adjustments.

Here's a svelte navbar example:

```html
{#snippet link(title)}
<li
  class="hover:text-blue-700 border-b-4 hover:border-blue-700 py-2 px-4 hover:bg-blue-50"
>
  <a href="#">{title}</a>
</li>
{/snippet}

<nav class="flex flex-row justify-between items-center">
  <a class="text-xl font-extrabold" href="/">Unicorn Corp</a>
  <ul class="flex flex-row gap-8 font-medium text-slate-700">
    {@render link('Home')} {@render link('About')} {@render link('Services')}
    {@render link('Contact')}
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### Grid

CSS Grid is primarily used for two-dimensional layouts, making column and item placement classes the most critical utilities.

- `display: grid;`: Using utility `grid` turns the container into a grid container.
- `grid-template-columns: repeat(n, 1fr);`: Using utilities `grid-cols-4`, `grid-cols-12`, etc defines the number of columns and makes them equally sized (using the `fr` unit).
- `grid-template-rows: repeat(n, 1fr);`: Using utilities `grid-rows-3`, `grid-rows-6`, etc defines the number of explicit rows.
- `grid-column: span n;`: Using utilities `col-span-2`, `col-span-full`, etc makes a grid item span across multiple columns.
- `grid-row: span n;`: Using utilities `row-span-3`, `row-span-full`, etc makes a grid item span across multiple rows.
- `gap: <size>;`: Using utilities `gap-4`, `gap-x-6`, `gap-y-2`, etc sets the spacing between grid items (gutters).
- `grid-column-start/end: <line>;`: Using utilities `col-start-3`, `col-end-5`, etc explicitly places an item starting and ending at specific column lines.
- `grid-row-start/end: <line>;`: Using utilities `row-start-2`, `row-end-4`, etc explicitly places an item starting and ending at specific row lines.
- `place-items: center;`: Using utility `place-items-center` centers content within all cells of the grid (combines `align-items` and `justify-items`.
- `grid-auto-flow: <orientation>;`: Using utilities like `grid-flow-col`, `grid-flow-dense` etc controls how items that aren't explicitly placed are automatically flowed.

Simple 4 column grid:

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  <div>01</div>
  <!-- ... -->
  <div>09</div>
</div>
```

Custom column specs (`1fr` = 1 unit of free space):

```html
<div class="grid-cols-[200px_minmax(900px,_1fr)_100px] ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```
