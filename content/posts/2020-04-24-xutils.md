The *X Window System* (aka X11 or X) is the de facto standard when it comes to windowing systems for bitmap displays on UNIX like environments. The Xorg open implementation, has seen the rise of X ubiquity, since its (X11) original inception at MIT in 1984.

Over all these years, many utility programs have been made to aid in the use and management of X. Some more useful than others, most are gems.

One such gem is [XScreenSaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/), a collection of 200+ screensavers for UNIX-like environments, developed and still actively maintained by the legendary jwz (Jamie Zawinski) in 1992.

The arch meta package [xorg-apps](https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/xorg-apps/) provides a great starting point for some of the useful utilities to manage your graphical environment.
